Becoming public: public pedagogy, citizenship and the public sphere

Abstract
This paper explores the question what kind of educational work can be done in attempts to reclaim or reinvigorate the public sphere. Through a discussion of the intersection of public sphere and public space, it engages with the work of Hannah Arendt in order to outline a conception of the public sphere as a space for civic action based on distance and the conservation of a degree strangeness rather than on commonality and common identity. The discussion of the educational work that can be done to support the public quality of common spaces and places focuses on three interpretations of the idea of public pedagogy: that of public pedagogy as a pedagogy for the public, that of public pedagogy as a pedagogy of the public and that of public pedagogy as the enactment of a concern for the public quality of human togetherness. The latter form of public pedagogy neither teaches nor erases the political by bringing it under a regime of learning, but rather opens up the possibility for forms of human togetherness through which freedom can appear, that is forms of human togetherness which contribute to the ‘becoming public’ of spaces and places.

Cet article examine les possibilités de réclamer ou revigorer le domaine public à partir de l'éducation. Il prend comme point de départ l'œuvre de Hannah Arendt pour entamer une discussion de l'intersection du domaine public et l'espace public et exposer brièvement ainsi une conception du domaine public comme espace pour action civique entreprise à la base de la distance sociale et de la rétention d'une certaine étrangeté plutôt que la communauté et l'identité commune. Cette discussion présent un travail éducatif qui puisse soutenir la qualité publique des espaces et des lieux communs qui se repose sur trois interprétations de l'idée de la pédagogie publique: la pédagogie publique comme pédagogie destinée au public; la pédagogie publique comme pédagogie conçue par le public; et la pédagogie publique comme la réalisation d'un souci de la qualité publique de l'intimité humaine. Cette dernière interprétation n'enseigne ni efface tout ce qui est politique mais ouvre plutôt la possibilité de créer les formes d'intimité humaine dans lesquelles la liberté peut exister, c'est-à-dire, des formes d'intimité humaine qui contribuent à la « transformation publique » des espaces et des lieux.

Este artículo se explora la cuestión de que tipo de trabajo educativo se puede hacer para recuperar o revigorizar la esfera pública. Através una discusión de la intersección de la esfera pública y el espacio público se involucra el trabajo de Hannah Arendt para construir una concepción de la esfera pública como un espacio para acción cívico basado en distancia y la conservación de lo extraño en vez de estar basado en una identidad en común. La discusión de trabajo educativo que puede apoyar la cualidad pública de espacios y lugares en común se enfoca en tres interpretaciónes del idea de una pedagogía pública: lo de pedagogía pública como una pedagogía por el público, lo de pedagogía pública como una pedagogía del público, y lo de pedagogía pública como la representación de una preocupación por la cualidad pública del unión humano. La última forma de pedagogía pública ni enseña ni borra la política por llevarlo abajo de un regimen de aprender, más bien se abre la posibilidad para formas del unión humano del cuál la libertad pueden aparecer, es decir, formas del unión humano que contribuyen a la llegada a ser público de espacios y lugares.

Introduction
At 10.00 am on the first of May 1996 Friedemann Derschmidt and four other artists had breakfast at the Schwarzenbergplatz in Vienna. This was the start of what since has become a world-wide phenomenon known as ‘permanent breakfast’ (see www.permanentbreakfast.org). The rules of permanent breakfast are simple: one person organises a breakfast in a public location and invites at least four other people to the breakfast. Those invited commit themselves to organising another public breakfast with different people in a different location, and so on (www.permanentsbreakfost.org: ‘the main idea’). The rules stipulate that every breakfast has to be recognisable as a breakfast (table, chairs and food) and that those having breakfast invite passers-by to the breakfast and explain the rules to them. The rules also indicate that everyone is individually responsible for the juridical implications of having the breakfast (see www.permanentsbreakfost.org: ‘rules of the game’). The ambition of permanent breakfast is to ‘breakfast’ (in German: ‘befrühstücken’) as many public places and spaces as possible and do so without advance notice or requests for permission, on the assumption that public places are precisely those places where things can be done without the need for anyone to give permission. In this regard, the breakfasts are claimed to serve as a kind of ‘litmus test’ of the extent to which the chosen location might indeed function as a public space, that is a space not determined by private agendas or interests (see www.permanentsbreakfost.org: ‘Vom Verlust des öffentlichen Raums’ on the loss of public space).

Permanent breakfast is but one example of a rapidly growing trend of staging artistic interventions in public places (see, for example Hall and Robertson 2001Hall, T. and Robertson, I. 2001. Public art and urban regeneration: advocacy, claims and critical debates. Landscape Research, 26: 5–26.

). Such interventions not only raise political questions about what it means for spaces and places to be public, which is particularly important against the background of concerns about the decline of the public sphere and the end of public space (see, for example Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004.

). They also raise educational questions about what it means to contribute to the reinvigoration of the public quality of spaces and places through such interventions—which has to do not only with the impact and effectiveness of such interventions but also with their justification and meaning as educational interventions. The political and the educational dimension come together in the idea of ‘public pedagogy’. Although much work on public pedagogy has focused on the analysis of how media, culture and society function as educative forces (see, for example Giroux 2004Giroux, H. 2004. Cultural studies and the politics of public pedagogy: making the political more pedagogical. Parallax, 10: 73–89.
[Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar]
), the idea of public pedagogy can also be understood in a more programmatic and more political way, which is as an educational intervention enacted in the interest of the public quality of spaces and places and the public quality of human togetherness more generally. The ambition of this paper is to articulate a notion of public pedagogy that connects the political and educational and locates both firmly in the public domain. The need for this stems not only from the ongoing privatisation and de-politicisation of public spaces and places (see below), but also from an ongoing privatisation and de-politicisation of education itself, one in which a view of education as an ongoing collective and political ‘project’ is replaced by a view of education as entirely private, that is, as a means for private advantage (see Biesta 2006aBiesta, G.J.J. 2006a. What's the point of lifelong learning if lifelong learning has no point? On the democratic deficit of policies for lifelong learning. European Educational Research Journal, 5: 169–180.

).

I develop my argument in the following way. I start with a discussion of the transformation of the public sphere, focusing on concerns about its decline and even its eclipse. I show the ways in which the idea of the public sphere is different from the idea of public space, which allows me to ask the question how public sphere actually ‘takes place’—both metaphorically and literally. To answer this question I turn to the work of Arendt (1906–1975), who provides a political ‘reading’ of the public sphere as a space ‘where freedom can appear’. For Arendt this is not so much a question of physical location as that it is about a particular quality of human togetherness which she characterises as ‘being together in the manner of speech and action’ (see below). In such terms the construction of public sphere can be understood as an ongoing process of ‘becoming public’. Becoming public is necessarily connected with the condition of plurality which, in a third step of my argument, I connect with the idea of a ‘citizenship of strangers’. Against this background I then turn to an exploration of the idea of ‘public pedagogy’. Here, I introduce a distinction between three forms of public pedagogy, to which I refer as a pedagogy for the public, a pedagogy of the public and a pedagogy that enacts a concern for ‘publicness’, respectively. I argue that the first two forms of public pedagogy run the risk of replacing politics by education, either by conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of instruction, or by understanding public pedagogy in terms of learning. Enacting a concern for publicness, so I suggest, is not about teaching individuals what they should be, nor about demanding from them that they learn, but is about forms of interruption that keep the opportunities for ‘becoming public’ open. In the concluding section, I bring the lines of my argument together in order to highlight how public pedagogy can be of political significance without losing its pedagogical identity.

This paper is a theoretical contribution aimed at an exploration of the intersection of politics and pedagogy in the context of discussions about artistic interventions in the public sphere. It aims to provide concepts and distinctions that can help with the empirical study of the significance and impact of such interventions. As I write this paper as an educationalist with an interest in questions of space, place, location and democratic politics, and not as a geographer, my ambition is confined to contributing educational insights to a wider discussion.

The decline of the public sphere
Over the past decades there has been a steady stream of work in which concerns have been raised about the transformation of the public sphere. Such work, which comes from a range of different disciplines and fields, including political theory, philosophy, geography, urban planning, architecture and education,2
2. The fact that the same topic is being discussed in a wide range of different disciplines and fields inevitably leads to a degree of concept proliferation and conceptual confusion. Thus, we find partly overlapping use of such notions as public sphere, public realm, public domain, public space and public place. This is partly the result of different discourses and traditions although there are also distinctions that do matter (particularly that between public sphere and public space). I will highlight some of these in this section without aiming at complete transparency or conceptual closure.

 tends to depict the transformation of the public sphere as a process of decline or loss, one in which essential qualities of the public sphere are under pressure, are at the brink of extinction or have already disappeared (see, for example Habermas 1989Habermas, J. 1989. The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

; Sennett 1992Sennett, R. 1992. The Fall of Public Man, New York: W.W: Norton.

). David Marquand, in his book Decline of the Public (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
), argues that the public sphere is being threatened from two ‘sides’, one being the (logic of the) market and the other being (the logic of) private interest. The neo-liberal shift from a public logic to a market logic is one where citizens are no longer involved in democratic contestation about the public good but have been turned into consumers of public services. Such citizen-consumers are being offered ‘choice’, ‘quality’ and ‘value for money’ from a set menu, rather than that they can influence what goes on the menu in the first place. The threat from the side of the private sphere is twofold, according to Marquand. There is first of all the ‘revenge of the private’ (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 79) which is about the resistance against the ‘hard, demanding, “unnatural” austerities of public duty and public engagement’ (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 79). The second aspect touches upon the idea of identity politics. Here, Marquand argues that the assumption that ‘the private self should be omni-competent and omnipresent’ has made deliberative politics of any sort ‘virtually impossible’ (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 80–82).

Marquand's evaluation of the decline of the public sphere stems from what Mitchell (1995Mitchell, D. 1995. The end of public space? People's park, definitions of the public, and democracy. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 85: 108–133.
[Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]
: 116) correctly characterises as a normative conception of public space, one in which ‘the public sphere is best imagined as the suite of institutions and activities that mediate the relations between society and the state’. Marquand does indeed define what he refers to as the public domain as ‘a space, protected from the adjacent market and private domains, where strangers encounter each other as equal partners in the common life of the society’ (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 27). The key function of the public domain, according to Marquand (2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 26), is to define the public interest and to produce public goods. This implies that the values ‘that sustain, and are sustained by, the public domain’ are not the values of self-interest but of collective interest (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 57). Hence they are political values. Given that collective interest may sometimes go against one's immediate self-interest, engagement with and commitment to the public domain require ‘a certain discipline’ and ‘a certain self-restraint’ (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 57). Marquand argues that this does not come naturally but has to be ‘learned and then internalised, sometimes painfully’ (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 57).

In the eyes of authors such as Marquand, the public domain—or with the term favoured by Habermas (1989Habermas, J. 1989. The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
 [Google Scholar]
): the public sphere—is not to be understood as a physical location, but first and foremost as a certain ‘form’ of interaction. Marquand refers to the public domain as a ‘set of activities’ with its own norms and decision rules, and emphasises that relationships in the public domain are different not only from those in the private domain ‘of love, friendship and personal connection’ but also from relationships in the market domain of ‘buying and selling [and] interest and incentive’ (Marquand 2004Marquand, D. 2004. Decline of the Public: The Hollowing-Out of Citizenship, Cambridge: Policy Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 4). The public domain so understood is thus basically seen as aspatial Mitchell (1995Mitchell, D. 1995. The end of public space? People's park, definitions of the public, and democracy. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 85: 108–133.
[Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]
: 116). Yet public sphere, in order to exist, needs to take place, both figuratively and literally. This means that the idea of the public sphere—a notion that plays a central role in political theory and philosophy—needs to be connected to the idea of public space—a notion that is more firmly located in fields such as geography, urban planning and architecture.

Although we could define public space in a ‘technical’ sense as any space that is not private—that is, privately owned, privately used and privately ‘determined’—this does not mean that any public space is automatically a political space, which is a space ‘that make[s] political activities possible’ (Mitchell 1995Mitchell, D. 1995. The end of public space? People's park, definitions of the public, and democracy. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 85: 108–133.
[Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]
: 115; see also Mitchell 2003Mitchell, D. 2003. The Right to the City: Social Justice and the Fight for Public Space, New York: The Guilford Press.
 [Google Scholar]
), or at least a space that does not make such activities impossible. Many commentators have pointed at the irony of the fact that while contemporary cities are actively increasing their stock of parks, squares, avenues, cycling paths and public buildings such as libraries, town halls or corporate plazas, the activities that are being allowed in such apparently public spaces are increasingly being limited and controlled (see, for example Jackson 1998Jackson, P. 1998. “Domesticating the street: the contested spaces of the high street and the mall”. In Images of the Street: Planning, Identity and Control in Public Space, Edited by: Fyfe, N.R. 176–191. London: Routledge.
 [Google Scholar]
). This is perhaps most visible in quasi-public spaces such as shopping malls which, while appearing to be open and accessible, are actually very actively policed so that only ‘proper’ activities take place within them and only ‘proper’ individuals are allowed to use such space (Staeheli and Mitchell 2006Staeheli, L. and Mitchell, D. 2006. USA's Destiny? Regulating space and creating community in American shopping malls. Urban Studies, 43: 977–992.
[Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]
). Quasi-public spaces are thus a prime example of the purification of public space (Sibley 1988Sibley, D. 1988. Survey 13: purification of space. Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 6: 409–421.
[Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]
), both with regard to its function (for example a narrowing of public space as space for consumption or for recreation which, in its modern guise, is more often than not itself a form of consumption) and with regard to its users.

It is in this way that the more empirical interest in public space links up with the more normative perspective of public sphere, that is with the question what kinds of actions and relationships are actually possible in ‘public’ spaces—and I put ‘public’ here in quotation marks because I will argue below that it is actually a particular form of action that makes spaces public—and, more specifically, whether any such spaces can still allow for action that might be characterised as ‘political’. This requires a further exploration of the meaning of political action, and for this I turn to the work of Hannah Arendt who, in my view, is one of the most political thinkers amongst twentieth-century political theorists and philosophers (Biesta 2010aBiesta, G.J.J. 2010a. How to exist politically and learn from it: Hannah Arendt and the problem of democratic education. Teachers College Record, 112: 558–577.

).

‘The space where freedom can appear’
Arendt's philosophy centres on an understanding of human beings as active beings, that is beings whose humanity is not simply defined by their capacity to think and reflect but where being human has to do with what one does. Arendt distinguishes between three modalities of the active life (the ‘vita activa’): labour, work and action. Labour is the activity that corresponds to the biological processes of the human body. It stems from the necessity to maintain life and is exclusively focused on the maintenance of life. It does so in endless repetition: ‘one must eat in order to labor and must labor in order to eat’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 143) Labour, therefore, creates nothing of permanence. Its efforts must be perpetually renewed so as to sustain life. Work, on the other hand, has to do with the ways in which human beings actively transform their environments and through this create a world characterised by durability. Work has to do with production and creation, and hence with instrumentality. It is concerned with making and therefore ‘entirely determined by the categories of means and end’ (ibid.). In this mode of activity the human being—as ‘homo faber’ rather than as ‘animal laborans’—is the builder of stable contexts within which human life can unfold.

Although labour and work have to do with instrumentality and necessity and with aims and ends that are external to the activity, action, the third mode of the vita activa, is an end in itself and its defining quality, so Arendt argues, is freedom. For Arendt to act first of all means to take initiative, to begin something new and to bring something new into the world. Arendt characterises the human being as an initium: a ‘beginning and a beginner’ (Arendt 1977Arendt, H. 1977. Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books.
 [Google Scholar]
: 170; emphasis added). She argues that what makes each of us unique lies in our capacity to do something that has not been done before. Here, Arendt likens action to the fact of birth, since with each birth something ‘uniquely new’ comes into the world (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 178). But it is not only at the moment of birth that something new comes into the world. We continuously bring new beginnings into the world through what we do and say. ‘With word and deed’, Arendt writes, ‘we insert ourselves into the human world and this insertion is like a second birth’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 176–177). It is therefore through action—and not through labour and work—that our ‘distinct uniqueness’ is revealed.

This is why action is intimately connected with freedom. Arendt emphasises, however, that freedom should not be understood as a phenomenon of the will, that is as the freedom to do whatever one chooses to do, but that we should instead conceive of it as the freedom ‘to call something into being which did not exist before’ (Arendt 1977Arendt, H. 1977. Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books.
 [Google Scholar]
: 151). The subtle difference between freedom as sovereignty and freedom as beginning has far-reaching consequences. The main implication is that freedom is not an ‘inner feeling’ or a private experience but something that is by necessity a public and hence a political phenomenon. ‘The rasion d'etre of politics is freedom’, Arendt writes, ‘and its field of experience is action’ (Arendt 1977Arendt, H. 1977. Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books.
 [Google Scholar]
: 146). Arendt stresses again and again that freedom needs a ‘public realm’ to make its appearance (Arendt 1977Arendt, H. 1977. Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books.
 [Google Scholar]
: 149). Moreover, freedom only exists in action, which means that human beings are free—as distinguished from their ‘possessing the gift of freedom’—as long as they act, ‘neither before nor after’ (Arendt 1977Arendt, H. 1977. Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises in Political Thought, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books.
 [Google Scholar]
: 153). How then can freedom appear?

In order to understand Arendt's answer to this question, it is crucial to see that ‘beginning’ is only half of what action is about. Although it is true that we reveal our distinct uniqueness through what we do and say, we should not think of this as a process through which we disclose some kind of pre-existing identity. Arendt writes that ‘nobody knows whom he reveals when he discloses himself in deed or word’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 180). Everything here depends on how others will respond to our initiatives. This is why Arendt writes that the agent is not an author or a producer, but a subject in the twofold sense of the word, namely the one who began an action and the one who suffers from and thus is subjected to its consequences. The basic idea of Arendt's understanding of action is therefore very simple: we cannot act in isolation. If I were to begin something but no one would respond, nothing would follow from my initiative and, as a result, my beginnings would not come into the world. I would not appear in the world. But if I begin something and others do take up my beginnings, I do come into the world and in precisely this moment I am free.

This means that our ‘capacity’ for action—and hence our freedom—crucially depends on the ways in which others take up our beginnings. The ‘problem’ is, however, that others respond to our initiatives in ways that are unpredictable. We are, after all, always acting upon beings ‘who are capable of their own actions’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 190). Although this frustrates our beginnings, Arendt emphasises that the ‘impossibility to remain unique masters of what [we] do’ is at the very same time the condition—and the only condition—under which our beginnings can come into the world (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 244). The point here is that we can of course try to control the ways in which others respond to our beginnings—and Arendt acknowledges that it is tempting to do so. But if we were to do so, we would deprive other human beings of their opportunities to begin. We would deprive them of their opportunities to act, and hence we would deprive them of their freedom. Arendt even goes so far as to argue that ‘to be isolated is to be deprived of the capacity to act’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 188). In order to be able to act we therefore need others—others who respond to our initiatives and take up our beginnings. This also means, however, that action is never possible without plurality. As soon as we erase plurality we deprive others of their actions and their freedom, and as a result we deprive ourselves of our possibility to act, and hence of our freedom. This is why Arendt maintains that ‘(p)lurality is the condition of human action’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 8).

Arendt thus provides us with a highly political understanding of freedom. This is not only because she sees freedom in terms of our appearance in the public realm and not, as is the case in liberal political theory, as something that is ultimately private. It is also, and more importantly, because she shows that our freedom is fundamentally interconnected with the freedom of others; it is contingent upon the freedom of others. The latter is not to be understood as just an empirical fact but rather as the normative core of Arendt's philosophy. Arendt is committed to a world in which everyone has the opportunity to act, appear and be free.

An important implication of this is that the public domain, the domain ‘in which freedom can appear’, should not be understood in physical terms, that is as a certain location, but denotes a particular quality of human interaction. As Arendt explains:

The polis, properly speaking, is not the city-state in its physical location; it is the organization of the people as it arises out of acting and speaking together, and its true space lies between people living together for this purpose, no matter where they happen to be. (...) It is the space of appearance in the widest sense of the word, namely, the space where I appear to others as others appear to me, where men [sic] exist not merely like other living or inanimate things but make their appearance explicitly. (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 198–199; emphasis in original)

The ‘space of appearance’ comes into being ‘when men [sic] are together in the manner of speech and action’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 199). This means that ‘unlike the spaces which are the work of our hands’, i.e. the spaces created through work, ‘it does not survive the actuality of the movement which brought it into being, but disappears (...) with the disappearance or arrest of the activities themselves’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 199).
Action is thus characterised by the fact that it is ‘entirely dependent upon the constant presence of others’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 23). This is one of the ways in which Arendt makes a distinction between the private and the public realm, in that labour and work do ‘not need the presence of others’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 22), whereas action does. In this way, we could say that Arendt allocates a proper place to each dimension of the vita activa. The private realm, the realm of the oikos or household, is concerned with the satisfaction of material need by means of labour and work carried out under the rule of necessity. The public realm, as Arendt puts it, ‘signifies the world itself, in so far as it is common to all of us’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 52). It is, however, ‘not identical with the earth or with nature’, but is related ‘to the human artefact, the fabrication of human hands, as well as to affairs which go on among those who inhabit the man-made world together’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 52). The ‘most elementary meaning’ of the two realms, the private and the public, therefore is ‘that there are things that need to be hidden and others that need to be displayed publicly if they are to exist at all’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.

A citizenship of strangers
Arendt's explorations of the interrelationships between action, freedom and plurality contain a very important lesson for our understanding of the public sphere, as she shows that it is only under the condition of plurality that action is possible and freedom—that is democratic freedom-as-beginning, not liberal freedom-as-sovereignty—can appear. She shows that as soon as we begin to reduce plurality, as soon as we begin to ‘homogenise’ and ‘purify’ public spaces by prescribing and policing what can be done and said in such spaces, by prescribing and policing what is ‘proper’ and what is ‘deviant’, we begin to eradicate the very conditions under which action is possible and freedom can appear.

To say that plurality is the condition of human action is not to suggest, however, that there simply needs to be plurality. Arendt is after something ‘stronger’, we might say, as she is not interested in plurality as such but in the question how collective action—acting ‘in concert’ as she puts it—is possible given ‘the simultaneous presence of innumerable perspectives and aspects in which the common world presents itself and for which no common measurement or denominator can ever be devised’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 57). Although she rejects the idea that common action is only possible on the basis of identity—that is on the basis of total agreement, total consensus or total sameness—she also maintains that common action is not possible on the basis of mere plurality. Common action requires decision and hence deliberation and judgement about what is to be done.

But just as Arendt rejects pluralism-without-judgement—the mere existence of plurality—she also rejects judgement-without-plurality. The notion she introduces in this context is that of ‘understanding’ (Arendt 1994Arendt, H. 1994. “Understanding and politics (the difficulties of understanding”. In Essays in Understanding 1930–1954, Edited by: Arendt, H. and Kohn, J. 307–327. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company.
 [Google Scholar]
). Understanding is, however, not about ‘correct information and scientific knowledge’ but is characterised by Arendt as ‘an unending activity by which, in constant change and variation, we come to terms with, reconcile ourselves to reality, that is, try to be at home in the world’ (Arendt 1994Arendt, H. 1994. “Understanding and politics (the difficulties of understanding”. In Essays in Understanding 1930–1954, Edited by: Arendt, H. and Kohn, J. 307–327. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company.
 [Google Scholar]
: 307–308). Understanding, she writes, ‘is the specifically human way of being alive, for every single person needs to be reconciled to a world into which he was born a stranger and in which, to the extent of his distinct uniqueness, he always remains a stranger’ (Arendt 1994Arendt, H. 1994. “Understanding and politics (the difficulties of understanding”. In Essays in Understanding 1930–1954, Edited by: Arendt, H. and Kohn, J. 307–327. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company.
 [Google Scholar]
: 308). Understanding is therefore not a bridge to the other, but has to do with a certain distance and strangeness—reconciling oneself with the ‘simultaneous presence of innumerable perspectives and aspects in which the common world presents itself and for which no common measurement or denominator can ever be devised’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 57).

As Hansen explains: understanding ‘results not from a fusion of individual wills, a kind of fraternity, but the preservation of a certain sort of distance that yet requires and makes possible worldly ties between people’ (Hansen 2005Hansen, P. 2005. Hannah Arendt and bearing with strangers. Contemporary Political Theory, 3: 3–22.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
: 6; emphasis in original). Common action under the condition of plurality is therefore not made possible through ‘fraternity’—a common identity, or a cosmopolitan sense of sameness—but relies on the preservation of distance and strangeness. If we understand actors in the public sphere as citizens, we can therefore say that Arendt's ideas about acting in concert whilst preserving plurality is about a citizenship of strangers. The idea of a citizenship of strangers hints at a mode of human togetherness in which plurality is actively preserved and, so we might say, actively pursued so that freedom can appear. The citizenship of strangers is thus about a mode of human togetherness which is not after a common ground but rather articulates an interest in a common world (Gordon 2001Gordon, M., ed. 2001. Hannah Arendt and Education: Renewing Our Common World, New York: Westview Press.
 [Google Scholar]
).

Although some might leave things here on the assumption that it is up to citizens themselves to sort out how they wish to relate and how, through this, they might be able to promote democratic forms of collective action, I am interested in the question how such forms of collective action—forms of action through which freedom can appear—might be promoted and sustained. More specifically, as an educationalist I am interested in the potential of education to contribute to the promotion of those forms of human action through which freedom can appear. I am interested, in other words, in the ways in which educational actions and interventions might have political ‘effect’ and ‘impact’.

Three forms of public pedagogy
The interest in the political role of education is neither new nor original. There is, on the one hand, a long and important tradition of scholarly work that operates at the intersection of education, citizenship and democratic politics and that sees the question of education as one that is intrinsically connected to wider political struggles (see, for example Coare and Johnston 2005Coare, P. and Johnston, R., eds. 2005. Adult Learning, Citizenship and Community Voices, Leicester: NIACE.

 [Google Scholar]
; Wildemeersch, Finger and Jansen 1998Wildemeersch, D., Finger, M. and Jansen, T. 1998. Adult Education and Social Responsibility, New York: Peter Lang.
 [Google Scholar]
). Some of this work is strongly rooted in a view which aims to build a society of ‘enlightened responsible and rational citizens’ and sees education as ‘the privileged tool’ in this process (Finger and Asun 2001Finger, M. and Asun, J.M. 2001. Adult Education at the Crossroads: Learning Our Way Out, Leicester: NIACE.
 [Google Scholar]
: 97). Our ‘postmodern’ times are characterised by a more hesitant attitude towards what education can achieve and what kind of image of society should be the reference point for such endeavours (Edwards 1997Edwards, R. 1997. Changing Places? Flexibility, Lifelong Learning and a Learning Society, London/New York: Routledge.
 [Google Scholar]
; Johnston 2005Johnston, R. 2005. “Adult learning and citizenship: clearing the ground”. In Adult Learning, Citizenship and Community Voices, Edited by: Coare, P. and Johnston, R. 3–19. Leicester: NIACE.
 [Google Scholar]
). In addition, there is also a long tradition of practical work that operates at the intersection of education, citizenship and democracy—educational ‘work’ that takes place in adult education, centres, community halls, libraries, the workplace, the Internet and even just ‘on the street’.

From the perspective of policy makers, there is often a strong expectation that such educational work can and should radically change existing conditions and practices. There are older traditions in which such expectations are formulated in terms of transformation, liberation and emancipation. And there are more recent views in which the expectations are formulated in terms such as ‘social capital’, ‘community cohesion’ or ‘good citizenship’. Educators who are involved in this work—for example as adult educators or as community educators—not only encounter such expectations from the side of policy makers who want their agendas to be ‘delivered’, but are also faced with strong expectations from the audiences they work with and for. Yet, community education is a fragile and unpredictable art, particularly when compared with school education which always operates in and through strong institutional infrastructures.

But if pedagogy goes ‘public’, so to speak, what would be an appropriate way to understand such public pedagogical ‘work’? Within the growing body of literature on public pedagogy (see, for example Sandlin, Schultz and Burdick 2010Sandlin, J.A., Schultz, B.D. and Burdick, J., eds. 2010. Handbook of Public Pedagogy: Education and Learning Beyond Schooling, Routledge: New York.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
), the idea of public pedagogy is predominantly used as an analytical concept aimed at theorising and investigating the educative ‘force’ of media, popular culture and society at large. Henry Giroux—branded by William Pinar as ‘the father of public pedagogy’ (Pinar 2010Pinar, W.F. 2010. “Foreword”. In Handbook of Public Pedagogy: Education and Learning Beyond Schooling, Edited by: Sandlin, J.A., Schultz, B.D. and Burdick, J. xv–xix. Routledge: New York.
 [Google Scholar]
: xviii)—describes his interest in public pedagogy as being concerned with ‘the diverse ways in which culture functions as a contested sphere over the production, distribution and regulation of power and how and where it operates both symbolically and institutionally as an educational, political and economic force’ (Giroux 2004Giroux, H. 2004. Cultural studies and the politics of public pedagogy: making the political more pedagogical. Parallax, 10: 73–89.
[Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar]
: 77). Although there is recognition within the North-American discourse on public pedagogy of more activist and more explicitly political strands of ‘education and learning beyond schooling’ (the subtitle of the Handbook of public pedagogy; Sandlin, Schultz and Burdick 2010Sandlin, J.A., Schultz, B.D. and Burdick, J., eds. 2010. Handbook of Public Pedagogy: Education and Learning Beyond Schooling, Routledge: New York.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
), there is little acknowledgement of the rich history of educational work in adult, community and popular education and of the Continental tradition of what, with a rather limited translation of the German word ‘Sozialpädagogik’, might be referred to as ‘social pedagogy’, that is pedagogy that operates outside of the confines of educational institutions such as the school or college. The idea that society may not only be an educative force but also has an educational responsibility (Perquin 1966Perquin, N.C.A. 1966. De Pedagogische Verantwoordelijkheid van de Samenleving. [The educational responsibility of society], Romen: Roermond.
 [Google Scholar]
) hints at a more programmatic interpretation of the idea of public pedagogy, where the notion of public pedagogy is not simply a way to analyse the socialising ‘force’ of society, but where pedagogy becomes an active and deliberate intervention in the ‘public’ domain. The critical question is how we might conceive of such a pedagogy and, more specifically, how we might do so in relation to questions about citizenship, democracy and the public sphere. I can see three different interpretations of such a more active and programmatic understanding of the idea of public pedagogy, and wish to make a case for the third of these.

One way to think of public pedagogy is as a pedagogy for the public. The main pedagogical ‘mode’ in this interpretation is that of instruction. In this conception of public pedagogy, the world is seen as a giant school and the main role of educational agents is to instruct the citizenry. This involves telling them what to think, how to act and, perhaps most importantly, what to be. Such a form of public pedagogy is therefore basically orientated towards the erasure of plurality and difference. We can see such a form of public pedagogy enacted whenever the state instructs its citizens to be, for example law-abiding, tolerant, respectful or active (and the state can either do this explicitly by telling its citizens how they should behave, or more implicitly through the range of systems of reward and punishment that the state can bring into operation to channel the behaviour of its citizens). But we can also find it in those situations where citizens are being mobilised or feel inclined to teach each other a lesson, thus revealing the moralistic undertone of this interpretation of public pedagogy. The main problem with this interpretation lies in the fundamental difference between the ‘logic’ of schooling and the ‘logic’ of democracy. From a democratic angle it is therefore important to remind ourselves that the world is not a school and also should not become a school (Bingham and Biesta 2010Bingham, C. and Biesta, G.J.J. 2010. Jacques Rancière: Education, Truth, Emancipation, London/New York: Continuum.
 [Google Scholar]
).

If the idea of public pedagogy as a form of teaching or instruction runs the risk of erasing the very plurality that is the condition for forms of human togetherness in which freedom can appear, then perhaps we need to approach the idea of public pedagogy in terms of learning. This is indeed the second interpretation of the idea of public pedagogy, which can be characterised as a pedagogy of the public. Here, the pedagogical work is not done from the ‘outside’, so to speak, but is located within democratic processes and practices, thus leading to an interest in the learning opportunities provided by such practices (van der Veen, Wildemeersch, Youngblood and Marsick 2007van der Veen, R., Wildemeersch, D., Youngblood, J. and Marsick, V., eds. 2007. Democratic Practices as Learning Opportunities, Rotterdam: Sense.
 [Google Scholar]
). The pedagogical ‘mode’ in this interpretation is that of learning or, in more political terms, that of what Paulo Freire has referred to as ‘conscientization’, a process aimed at the generation of critical awareness and ‘critical consciousness’ (Freire 1970Freire, P. 1970. Pedagogy of the Oppressed, New York: Continuum.
 [Google Scholar]
). Here, we might think of the world as a giant adult education class in which educational agents perform the role of facilitator. Unlike in the first interpretation of public pedagogy, the direction in which such processes move is not determined from the outset, but is part of what is ‘at stake’ in such processes of collective political learning. Although this interpretation of public pedagogy therefore connects much better to the idea of plurality, one limitation of this view is that it brings democracy under a ‘regime’ of learning—and in the Freirean version this is a very particular kind of learning aimed at overcoming alienation from the world (Freire 1972Freire, P. 1972. Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Harmondsworth: Penguin.
 [Google Scholar]
; Galloway 2012Galloway, S. 2012. Reconsidering emancipatory education: staging a conversation between Paulo Freire and Jacques Rancière. Educational Theory, 62: 163–184.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
). This, in turn, suggests that public pedagogy as a pedagogy of the public comes with a particular conception of political agency in which (political) action follows from (political) understanding—and perhaps we can add that agency here follows from the right, correct or true understanding (for a critical discussion of this idea see Biesta 2010bBiesta, G.J.J. 2010a. How to exist politically and learn from it: Hannah Arendt and the problem of democratic education. Teachers College Record, 112: 558–577.
[Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]
). Whether the identity of educational agents can therefore entirely be understood in terms of facilitation, or whether it is the case that they need to facilitate a particular kind of learning aimed at a particular kind of understanding, depends to a large extent on one's views about the kind of knowledge and understanding that political learning should generate, and that political action requires. It is, however, in the more general demand that individuals learn—i.e. that they need to learn and must learn in order to become (better) political actors—that some of the limitations of this interpretation of public pedagogy become visible.

It is precisely for these reasons that the conception of public pedagogy that I will outline below differs from the direction that can be found in Ellsworth (2004Ellsworth, E. 2004. Places of Learning. Media, Architecture, Pedagogy, London/New York: Routledge.
 [Google Scholar]
). Although Ellsworth moves away from the idea of instruction or teaching in her exploration of places of learning which are located outside of educational institutions such as the school, and in this shift identifies what she refers to as ‘anomalous places of learning’, she remains strongly focused on processes and practices of learning. Yet unlike what is often assumed, learning is not some kind of open and natural process that can go in any direction, but is actually a very particular and specific ‘regime’—to use a Foucauldian phrase; a regime, moreover, that demands a particular relation of the self to the self, that is a relation of awareness, reflection and conclusion. In this sense, one might say that the learning regime remains an educational regime, even if it occurs in anomalous places or under anomalous forms. The main motivation for the reading of public pedagogy that I offer below is to move beyond such a ‘regime’ so that public pedagogy can work at the intersection of education and politics, and is not drawn back into an educational logic that, even under the guise of learning, tends to remain a logic of schooling. I am responding, in other words, to what I have discussed elsewhere (Biesta 2012Biesta, G.J.J. 2012. Have adult education and emancipation still something to say to each other?. Studies in the Education of Adults, 44: 5–20.
[Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar]
) as the ‘politics of learning’, that is the tendency to turn social and political problems into learning problems, so that, through this, they become the responsibility of individuals rather than that they are seen as the concern of the collective.

Instead of seeing public pedagogy as a pedagogy for the public or of the public, there is therefore a different interpretation possible, one where public pedagogy appears as an enactment of a concern for ‘publicness’ or ‘publicity’, that is a concern for the public quality of human togetherness and thus for the possibility of actors and events to become public. Becoming public is not about a physical relocation from the home to the street or from the oikos to the polis, but about the achievement of a form of human togetherness in which, to put it in the language of Hannah Arendt, action is possible and freedom can appear. It is a form of human togetherness characterised by plurality. If we understand public sphere as a quality of human togetherness, then we might say that becoming public is the creation of public sphere. In this interpretation the educational agent—the public pedagogue—is neither an instructor nor a facilitator but rather someone who interrupts (Biesta 2006bBiesta, G.J.J. 2006b. Beyond Learning. Democratic Education for a Human Future, Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers.
 [Google Scholar]
). Such interruptions take the form of what, after Rancière, we might think of as ‘dissensus’. Dissensus is not to be understood as the ‘opposition of interests or opinions [but is] the production, within a determined, sensible world, of a given that is heterogeneous to it’ (Rancière 2003Rancière, J. 2003. The Philosopher and His Poor, Durham, NC: Duke University Press.
 [Google Scholar]
: 226). To ‘stage’ dissensus is to introduce an incommensurable element—an event, an experience and an object—that can act both as a test and as a reminder of publicness. It is an element that can act as a ‘test’ of the public quality of particular forms of togetherness and of the extent to which actual spaces and places make such forms of human togetherness possible. The aim of such interruptions is not to teach actors what they should be, nor to demand a particular kind of learning, but to keep open the opportunities for becoming public or, in Arendtian terms, to keep open the possibility of a space where freedom can appear.

Whereas the first two interpretations of public pedagogy run the risk of replacing politics with education—the first interpretation takes politics out by teaching citizens how to act and be, whereas the second takes politics out by bringing it under a regime of learning—the third interpretation hints at both a different educational dynamic and a different political dynamic. And this brings me back to the very start of this paper and the example of permanent breakfast.

Discussion
I started this paper with a brief vignette about permanent breakfasts. The permanent breakfast ‘movement’, as mentioned, is but one example of a much wider trend to stage artistic ‘interventions’ in public spaces. What is interesting about such interventions, and that is why the example of permanent breakfast is helpful for my discussion about public pedagogy, is that such interventions often do very little. Permanent breakfast is not set up as a form of instruction that tells citizens what they should do and be, nor does it present an exemplary form or mode of citizenship and civic action that would deserve repetition. At most those organising a breakfast have the intention to invite others to join in, but those joining in are there to have breakfast—and the rules indeed stipulate that the breakfast has to be real. Just as permanent breakfasts do not operate as a form of instruction—they are, in that sense, not a pedagogy for the public—they also do not function as a pedagogy of the public. They are not study circles, discussion groups or political awareness meetings; again, they are breakfasts.

They are, however, breakfasts that are explicitly ‘out of place’ and this makes them potentially important, both politically and educationally.3
3. It is important to bear in mind that such effects are never guaranteed and that we should even be aware of the possibility of saturation, that is that what starts out as being ‘out of place’ can, over time, become ‘domesticated’ and thus lose its potential to interrupt and test what is possible in a particular location. This is a particular risk with artistic interventions that, although out of place in one respect, can quickly lose their capacity to interrupt simply by calling them artistic. This is why the idea of permanent breakfast is perhaps more interesting than forms of interruption which are more easily recognisable as ‘artistic’.

 Politically such interventions are important because they can act as a test—a ‘litmus test’ as the initiators of permanent breakfast call it—of the public ‘quality’ of a particular location. They can function as a test, in other words, of what is possible in that location and in this way they can reveal whether particular spaces are determined, controlled and policed, or are open to a plurality of being and doing. Educationally such interventions are important because they enact a form of pedagogy that is neither based on superior knowledge of an educator—so that the educator would be in a position to tell others how to act and how to be—nor about putting the educator in the role of a facilitator of learning—thus putting the whole process under a learning ‘regime’. Permanent breakfasts rather are an example of an enactment of a concern for the publicness or public quality of particular spaces and places, an enactment of a concern for the possibility of forms of human togetherness in which freedom can appear—forms of human togetherness through which such spaces and places can become public.

It is important to see that this does not make such interventions themselves into political acts.4
4. The recognition that interventions such as permanent breakfast are not in themselves political acts is important in order to prevent a potential misreading of my argument. The issue here has to do with Arendt's distinction between the social and the political. Read in those terms, it is clear that the activity of having breakfast would fall under Arendt's definition of the social as it has to do with an activity that belongs to the private sphere, the sphere of the household or ‘oikos’. Arendt's critique of modernity is precisely aimed at the way in which activities from the private sphere have ‘colonised’ the public sphere, so that the public sphere has become entirely orientated towards the preservation of life (a biological process). For Arendt this ‘rise of the social’ (Arendt 1958Arendt, H. 1958. The Human Condition, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
) thus forms a very serious threat to the possibility action, politics and freedom. My point with using the example of permanent breakfast is, however, not to present it as a political act or intervention, but as a form of public pedagogy that expresses a concern for the public quality of spaces and places of human togetherness. In this regard such forms of public pedagogy are precisely meant to ‘push back’ the colonisation of the public realm by the social.

 What they can do at most is prepare the terrain for political action, so to speak. Political demands are, after all, not simply about any interruption or any experience of being ‘out of place’, but need to be connected with core democratic values of equality and freedom—even if such values are always in (paradoxical) tension with each other (Mouffe 2000Mouffe, C. 2000. The Democratic Paradox, London/New York: Verso.
 [Google Scholar]
). This is particularly relevant for those interventions in the public domain that can in some way or form be characterised as ‘artistic’, as it takes away the problem of a certain instrumentalisation of art, one where art, if it has to be politically significant, has to become political itself and thus would lose its artistic ‘quality’, so to speak. It also shows, in conclusion, how one might understand the political significance of public pedagogy in the particular interpretation that I have suggested in this paper, in that it can help to see that public pedagogy as an enactment of a concern for publicness, a concern for the possibility of the appearance of freedom, does not turn pedagogy into politics but rather reveals how pedagogy can be politically significant.

2. The fact that the same topic is being discussed in a wide range of different disciplines and fields inevitably leads to a degree of concept proliferation and conceptual confusion. Thus, we find partly overlapping use of such notions as public sphere, public realm, public domain, public space and public place. This is partly the result of different discourses and traditions although there are also distinctions that do matter (particularly that between public sphere and public space). I will highlight some of these in this section without aiming at complete transparency or conceptual closure.

3. It is important to bear in mind that such effects are never guaranteed and that we should even be aware of the possibility of saturation, that is that what starts out as being ‘out of place’ can, over time, become ‘domesticated’ and thus lose its potential to interrupt and test what is possible in a particular location.
