Public history and the fragments of place: archaeology, history and heritage site development in southern Alberta
James Opp

Abstract
The recent call for heritage professionals to consider the ‘spirit of place’ is an attempt to reconcile the overlapping layers of tangible and intangible heritage within significant sites. However, the desire for wholeness can also displace the fragments and fragmented histories of place. This paper examines the history of heritage development in southern Alberta through two sites, namely Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump (a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park / Áísínai'pi National Historic Site (UNESCO World Heritage nomination currently being developed). Located only 200 km apart, these two places offer very different perspectives on the ‘spirit of place’ and present very different histories of the production of ‘heritage’ through archaeological excavation, preservation practices and Aboriginal consultation. These stories from the Canadian prairies raise questions about the processes of ‘place-making’, ‘place-taking’ and how we mobilize and conceptualize the practice of place in public history.

The visible traces of our time here on Earth are little more than the material representation of the values, beliefs, myths, and customs that shape who we are and influence our vision of the world and how we live in it.

It is through these traces and witnesses that the soul of a people is revealed, and it is in that revelation that we find meaning.

The meaning of history.

The meaning of life.

We all share a profound belief that this intangible heritage must exist beyond the reach of time, archived and conserved, safe from every threat, just as we do with the most extraordinary building projects and important archaeological sites.

Failure to do so would be to betray or undermine the meaning – the spirit – of those places that we have inherited and that enrich our present. (Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, 2009).

In her opening speech for the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) General Assembly and Scientific Symposium in Quebec City, 2008, Canada's Governor General Michaëlle Jean called upon delegates to find the ‘spirit of place’ by listening, imagining and knowing that ‘where the past is alive and can be seen, touched and felt, every fragment whispers with the voices of a civilization, revealing the essence of those who came before us’ (Jean 2009). Such heady words echo nineteenth-century currents of romantic idealism more than twenty-first-century postmodern (or post-postmodern?) sensibilities. For ICOMOS and the Quebec City organizers, the ‘spirit of place’ serves as a matrix for pulling together the traditional concern with the physical traces of heritage with a growing emphasis upon ‘intangible’ heritage. It is a framework for bridging two key UNESCO conventions, namely the 1972 World Heritage Convention with its corresponding World Heritage List, and the 2003 Intangible Cultural Heritage Convention, which came into force in 2006. The latter was developed in response to criticisms that the sites on the World Heritage List favoured western nations and focused too much on monumentality and aesthetics, rather than aspects of heritage that were less material in nature, including folklore and oral tradition (Smith and Akagawa 2009). As Laurier Turgeon explains, through the spirit of place, the tangible sets the conditions for evoking ‘the enduring qualities and the layers of memory corresponding to the various levels of occupation of the site’, while the intangible renews ‘the original significance of the place or even invest[s] it with a variety of meanings in order to satisfy the competing claims of the groups of people co-inhabiting the location’ (Turgeon 2009, XXXVIII). For heritage practitioners, then, the spirit of place is both a dialectical relationship and a process, allowing heritage sites to transcend the ordinary while maintaining the capacity to encompass multiple, competing ‘spirits’ and understandings of place.

Incorporating plural perspectives and including more local communities in the planning and management of heritage sites is a laudable goal, but the recent trend towards revealing the ‘spirit of place’ relies upon an inherent essentialism of ‘place’. Despite the many qualifications that reframe the process as multi-faceted, fluid and always changing, this approach still invokes a fundamental enchantment, the discernment of ‘authentic’ connections between the material and spiritual, the tangible and intangible. As the Quebec Declaration makes clear, the spirit of place ‘offers a fuller understanding of the living and, at the same time, permanent character of monuments, sites and cultural landscapes. It provides a richer, more dynamic, and inclusive vision of cultural heritage’ (Quebec Declaration, reprinted in Turgeon 2009, 430). In the twenty-first century, the authority of an ‘authenticity’ invested solely in strict codes of material preservation or ‘unfeeling heritage’ (Byrne 2009Byrne, Denis. 2009. “A critique of unfeeling heritage”. In Intangible heritage, Edited by: Smith, Laurajane and Natsuko, Akagawa. New York: Routledge.
 [Google Scholar]
) is no longer sufficient.

The discursive shift from ‘site’ to ‘place’ signals a wider aspiration to recast heritage as more than what is defined as significant through scientific and archaeological study – places are spaces of identity formation, they function as an ‘anchor of shared experiences’ in ways that sites do not (L. Smith 2006Smith, Laurajane. 2006. Uses of heritage, New York: Routledge.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
, 76). This is the language of a hermetic wholeness, which elevates the enterprise to sometimes dizzying heights. If Jean’s language is less restrained than most of the participants at the Quebec conference, her speech points to a recurring tendency to transform multiple parts into singular wholes (‘traces and witnesses’ become a ‘soul’, ‘whispering voices’ reveal a ‘civilization’ and the ‘essence’ of previous inhabitants).

The significance of drawing attention to the ‘spirit’ or a ‘sense of place’ is not new in international heritage policy, and it has arguably been present in various forms and to varying degrees since the 1972 World Heritage Convention (Cameron 2009Cameron, Christina. 2009. “Finding the spirit of place: A world heritage perspective”. In Spirit of place: Between tangible and intangible heritage, Edited by: Turgeon, Laurier. 15–22. Quebec: Les Presses de l'Université Laval.
 [Google Scholar]
). However, the desire for wholeness tends to displace the uncomfortable fragments and fragmentations of place that continue to disturb the histories and landscapes that confront us both in and out of place. What histories are omitted in the production of public narratives that reconcile contested heritage sites? How does one come to terms with the ‘full weight’ (Wrobel 2002Wrobel, David M. 2002. Promised lands: Promotion, memory, and the creation of the American West, Lawrence, KS: University of Kansas Press.
 [Google Scholar]
, 198) of the legacies of promotion that continue to mark and influence one's sense of place? Despite long-standing calls to recognize ‘dissonance’ in heritage studies (Tunbridge and Ashworth 1996Tunbridge, J.E. and Ashworth, G.J. 1996. Dissonant heritage: The management of the past as a resource in conflict, Chichester, NY: J. Wiley.
 [Google Scholar]
), Laurajane Smith (2005) argues that the prevailing tendency is to regard conflict as site-specific and subject to proper management, obscuring wider political and social contexts at stake (2006). Therefore, how can one assess ‘heritage’ itself as a cultural practice, a ‘multilayered performance’ that validates and constitutes its own subjectivity, and yet remains ‘inherently dissonant and contested’ (Smith 2006Smith, Laurajane. 2006. Uses of heritage, New York: Routledge.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
, 3–4)?

To ask these questions raises a host of other issues surrounding authority, communities and public memory (Walkowitz and Knauer 2009Walkowitz, Daniel J. and Knauer, Lisa Maya. 2009. Contested histories in public space: Memory, race, and nation, Durham, NC: Duke University Press.

; Smith 2004Smith, Laurajane. 2004. Archaeological theory and the politics of cultural heritage, New York: Routledge.

). As a historian, however, I want to focus particularly on the spatial histories and the markings of place for two heritage sites located on the Canadian prairie of southern Alberta, namely Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump (a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park/Áísínai'pi National Historic Site (listed as a ‘tentative’ nominee, with a full nomination for UNESCO World Heritage Site status in preparation for 2012). These two sites, only 200 km apart from each other, offer very different perspectives on the ‘spirit of place’ and present very different histories of the production of ‘heritage’ through archaeological and preservation practices.

In exploring some of the fragments of place in these histories, I also want to call attention to the reciprocal mobilities of ‘place-making’ and ‘place-taking’. It is here, in the cracks and fissures that disrupt the wholeness, that one can see the multiple ‘practices’ of place (Cresswell 2004Cresswell, Tim. 2004. Place: A short introduction, Malden, MA: Blackwell.
 [Google Scholar]
, 2008Cresswell, Tim. 2008. Comments in forum Landscape, mobility, practice. Social and Cultural Geography, 9(2): 191–211.
 [Google Scholar]
), and it is here that the incongruous fragments of place that remain both geographically ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ can be understood. As Tim Cresswell argues in his discussion of Michel de Certeau's The practice of everyday life, ‘Practice is thus a tactical art that plays with the structures of place that are provided. The mobile world of practice teases apart place in its orthodox form’ (Cresswell 2002Cresswell, Tim. 2002. “Theorizing place”. In Mobilizing place, placing mobility: The politics of representation in a globalized world, Edited by: Verstraete, Ginette and Cresswell, Tim. Amsterdam-New York: Rodopi.
 [Google Scholar]
, 24).

If one needs to be cautious about overarching narratives of place as expressions of an ideal wholeness, I am similarly aware of my own limitations in narrating the fragments of place as both an outsider and an insider to these processes and communities. Jeff Malpas suggests that ‘One cannot come to a sense of a place without also coming to a sense of one's own implication in that place’ (2008). Growing up in southern Alberta, these sites and landscapes are a part of my own personal history, identity and ‘sense of place’, which was shaped in part by working as a teenage newsletter editor at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump. Although I focus closely on heritage practices, inscriptions and resistances in relation to the corresponding inclusions and exclusions of Aboriginal participation in the production of place, my view is only partial, at best. The Niitsitapi/Blackfoot 1
 1. Niitsitapi/Niitsitapiiski, ‘Real or True Person/People’, is a word that can apply to all Aboriginal peoples (Bastien 2004). It is also sometimes used as a term of reference for Blackfoot-speaking nations, which include the Siksika (Blackfoot), the Kainaa (Blood), the Piikáni (North Peigan or Apatohsipiikani) and the Blackfeet (South Piegan or Amsskaapipiikani) in Montana, especially in public exhibitionary contexts such as the Glenbow Museum's Niitsitapiisini exhibit (glenbow.org/blackfoot and The Blackfoot Gallery Committee 2001). A more cultural sense of the word is as ‘a term designating how Blackfoot recognize themselves, through their socio-cultural practices, laws, and relationships with the Creator as distinct from other people who do not share those practices’ (Noble 2008). However, adopting Blackfoot words into English raises many contextual issues. There are variations in how the singular and plural forms are used within an English text, and other words with a more geographically specific meaning are also used to denote Blackfoot-speaking nations or people, such as Siksiksaitsitapi (Bastien 2004) or Siksikáítapiiksi (Blood and Chambers 2009). My thanks to Narcisse Blood and Cynthia (2009) Chambers for responding to my enquiries on the usage of these terms. To avoid confusion, I have tended to use either Niitsitapi or Blackfoot, because these are the terms most often used in public exhibition and interpretive contexts. However, any errors or omissions in using Blackfoot terms are entirely my own.

 understandings, ways of knowing and experiences of place are larger stories which are not mine to tell.

I
Writing in the 1960s, Calgary Herald columnist Ken Liddell pronounced that ‘I read road maps like I read railway timetables …  like just for kicks, man, as the beatnick would say’. The catalyst for thinking about maps was that Writing-on-Stone, an area that appeared as a park on a federal government highway map, was ignored completely by an oil company tourist map, and on an Alberta government map it was unnamed, but marked as a park area by a tree symbol. Even more mystifying for Liddell was a two-province map of Alberta and British Columbia which ‘listed Writing On Stone [sic] as a reserve. Trees or Indians?’ One report marked it as a ‘historic site’, while other publications on provincial points of interest ignored it altogether. It seems that most tourists found Writing-on-Stone by asking at local service stations in the nearby town of Milk River, and Liddell proclaimed that ‘whoever is responsible for deciding such things’ should get their ‘thinking cap’ on and ‘decide whether Writing On Stone [sic] is an Alberta provincial park, a reserve or an historical site’ (Liddell c. 1965).

The cartographic confusion of half-century ago has now given way to more coherent mapping, visible signage, well-maintained roads and a newly constructed (2007) interpretive centre. The transformation has also been marked with a name change, as the building is known officially as the Writing-on-Stone/Áísínai'pi Visitor Centre. A provincial government press release excitedly proclaimed that the new centre offered visitors an opportunity to ‘experience Blackfoot culture’, and heralded the consultation with Aboriginal elders and the Mookaakin Heritage and Cultural Society 2
 2. The Mookaakin Heritage and Cultural Society was formed in 1998 and is affiliated with the Kainai Nation. Led by members of traditional Kainaa cultural and spiritual societies, it promotes traditional Kainaa observances, language and history, encourages public appreciation for Kainaa culture, and is actively involved in the repatriation of ceremonial objects and artefacts (Klassen 2003b; Conaty 2008; Bell, Statt, and the Mookakin Cultural Society 2008).

 in designing a circular building with an eastern opening, echoing the construction of tipis (Government of Alberta 2007Government of Alberta. 2007.
http://alberta.ca/acn/200706/2169949CEC293-B0D9–791C-B4F46C95C0BEC67E.html
 [Google Scholar]
). The narrative inside the centre foregrounds Niitsitapi understandings of Áísínai'pi (‘it is pictured/written’) as a ‘sacred landscape, where rock art connects them to the Spirit world’. The centrepiece of the park is the concentration of thousands of petroglyphs and pictographs which line the sandstone cliffs along the Milk River, but the visitor centre also recasts these markings as the product of place, made powerful by the wider sacred landscape. In particular, the visible presence of Kaytoyissiiksi (the Sweetgrass Hills) is significant, as it is the resting place of Kaytoyissa, who made the world safe for the Blackfoot. Áísínai'pi is not framed as a place of the past; instead, it is very much presented as a place of continuing significance for Blackfoot people, a place for teaching, a place of ceremonies and a place of visions.

At the same time, sitting uneasily within this overarching framework are other narratives of place that acknowledge the local settler community as having a stake in Writing-on-Stone as a ‘special place’. The park is also a ‘shared place’, and local residents are credited with protecting the rock art and for their persistent efforts in establishing a park. At one point, the two stories of place are paralleled in listening posts where visitors can listen to both Aboriginal and settler stories, using separate ‘phones’ for each, but both under the title ‘Our elders remember’. Such interpretive framings appear to exemplify how the Quebec Convention understands the lens of a ‘spirit of place’ for heritage policy, reconciling multiple perspectives and interests while drawing attention to the linkages of the tangible and intangible components of place.

And yet, visitors to the closed Archaeological Preserve – accessible only by guided tour – are confronted with the presence of modern rodeo grounds only a few yards away from the sandstone cliffs. During the tour that that I take, this intrusion into the landscape is explained as something that ‘they’ (interpreters? the Parks Department? the provincial government?) have no control over, and discussion quickly shifts to other topics. In the archival files of the parks department, exasperated superintendents constantly complained about the annual rodeo, which produced problems with traffic, drinking, illegal camping and increased vandalism to the rock art. Reports and consultants unanimously agreed that the rodeo grounds were incompatible with the mandate of the park, but such efforts were stymied by local resistance to moving the corrals. In 1980, a separate access road was built, a chain link fence was installed, and strict rules for organizers were implemented in order to allow the rodeo to continue on long-term leases (Alberta Environmental Protection 1997Alberta Environmental Protection. 1997. Management plan: Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park Prairie Region, Natural Resources Service, Department of Environmental Protection
 [Google Scholar]
; Underwood McLellan & Associates 1973).

Here was a very visible dissonance, one that pointed to long-standing practices of place that were not easily accommodated within the narrative of the visitor centre. The tableau of rock art visible in Figure 1 is one of the most widely photographed scenes at Áísínai'pi. My own parents took pictures in this same spot in 1970 on a camera club outing (Opp 2010Opp James Walsh John C. Placing memory and remembering place in Canada UBC Press Vancouver 2010
 [Google Scholar]
), but not until I returned to their archive of work with new eyes did I realize that the fencelines in the background of one slide were actually the same rodeo grounds that have been in use since the late 1950s. 3
 3. Rodeos have been hosted at Writing-on-Stone since 1966, but the corrals have been maintained by the local Writing-On-Stone Riding Association since the late-1950s (Hughson 1983). Michael Klassen notes that, during the 1960s and 1970s, when the ceremonial use of Áísínai'pi was at its lowest, many Blackfoot people still visited as part of the annual rodeo (2005, 37).

 Most images from this spot invariably frame the scene to focus on the petroglyphs themselves, excluding the visual disruptions of the landscape. Visitors and heritage officials alike have maintained a selective vision in reconciling the artistic and formal qualities of place, and selective visions have long guided a variety of understandings about what Writing-on-Stone should be.

When Alberta passed its first parks act in 1929, the listed purposes of creating provincial parks was to provide recreation, to preserve ‘wild animal life and wild vegetation,’ and to protect ‘objects of geological, ethnological, historical and other scientific interest’ (Provincial Parks Branch 1972Provincial Parks Branch. 1972. “Writing on Stone history project. Unpublished manuscript commissioned by the Alberta Department of Lands and Forest”. In Glenbow Archives, M4442, File 12
 [Google Scholar]
, 51). Local ranchers and their political representatives lobbied for Writing-on-Stone to be named as a provincial park, and land was reserved for this purpose in 1935, but legal issues around land titles and the economic conditions of the depression era curtailed development. Outside experts had to petition the government to even set up signs warning against vandalism, and expressed concern over reports of shooting up the rock art with .22 bullets (Smith 1935Smith, Harlan I. 1935. Letter to Parks. Department, November 7. Provincial Archives of Alberta, 1983.498 Box 17, file 663,
 [Google Scholar]
). The public notice that government officials posted as a result did far more than simply warn against defacing the rocks, it also served to recast the significance of Writing-on-Stone:

Public Notice

The petroglyphs or picture writings inscribed on the rocks in this vicinity are the works of an ancient race which inhabited this area prior to the advent of the white man.

Antiquities of this nature in the Dominion of Canada are rare and of inestimable historical and archaeological value.

The Provincial Parks Board appeals to the public for their co-operation in protecting these writings from vandalism.

Any person found guilty of marring or destroying the same will be liable to prosecution. (Provincial Parks Board n.d., c. 1935)

The appeal to visitors to see the significance of Writing-on-Stone as the product of an ‘ancient’ race was an attempt to elevate its heritage value, but such discourses also severed the longstanding connections between the Blackfoot and Áísínai'pi. By transposing a linear chronology onto place, a modern settler culture could consume the nostalgia of prehistoric imaginings without having to face, as Philip J. Deloria puts it, ‘Indians in unexpected places’ (2004). This was a familiar refrain at the turn of the century, the popularization of a colonial ‘archaeological gaze’ which spatialized ‘panoptic time’ in linking deep pasts with the surfaces areas of the ‘New World’. As Tony Bennett (2004) suggests, ‘colonised peoples could be represented as primitive, but not ancient …’ (Bennett 2004, 63; McClintock 1995McClintock, Anne. 1995. Imperial leather: race, gender, and sexuality in the colonial contest, New York: Routledge.
 [Google Scholar]
; Trigger 1984Trigger, Bruce. 1984. Alternative archaeologies: nationalist, colonialist imperialist. Man, 19: 355–370.
[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]
). Such characterizations came in spite of the existing ‘expert’ evidence that linked some of the rock art to more recent events in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Smith 1935Smith, Harlan I. 1935. Letter to Parks. Department, November 7. Provincial Archives of Alberta, 1983.498 Box 17, file 663,
 [Google Scholar]
). Even though at least one newspaper report indicated that Áísínai'pi was ‘well known’ to First Nations people in the area, with many undertaking ‘pilgrimages to the spot, gazing at the message from the dead’ (Long 1928), such mobilizations of place were regarded as out of step with the modern world and ‘out of time’ in understanding the origins (and therefore ‘authentic’ significance) of the rock art.

In the 1920s and 1930s, local residents focused on developing facilities and turning Writing-on-Stone into more than an informal community picnic area. The Lethbridge Herald managing editor prophesied that the ‘tourist world’ would one day know about Writing-on-Stone, bringing thousands to the area (Long 1928). Others speculated that, if the area could be designated as a national park, development would follow, including ‘a pavilion, swimming pool, shelters, and other buildings for the comfort and amusement of the public’ (Burkitt 1936Burkitt, Rhyrza Young. 1936. “‘Writing on Stone’ bears tales of incidents in lives of people of ancient day”. In Albertan April 4. Newspaper clipping, Glenbow Archives, M4442, file 3
 [Google Scholar]
). Oil drilling in the vicinity in the late-1930s struck a deposit of warm sulphur water, and many in the community fostered the hope that this resource could be developed into a mineral pool and a tourist attraction, but costs and health concerns over the mixture of sulphur and gas killed the project in the mid-1950s (Schmitt 1983Schmitt, Emma. 1983. “Oil exploration”. In From sandstone to settlers: Writing-on-Stone district history, Milk River: Masinasin Historical Society and Masinasin New Horizon's Society.
 [Google Scholar]
). Through volunteer labour and donated materials, picnic tables, camp stoves and a baseball diamond were eventually constructed, with local residents serving as the unofficial caretakers.

For two decades, the park existed on paper, but received little attention from the provincial government until 1957, when Writing-on-Stone was formally re-established with camping facilities and a new access road. Members of the Kainai Nation were invited to attend the opening ceremonies, and their presence was noted in all the press coverage given to the event. However, three years later, the Kainaa were not on hand, and were probably not invited, to a second ceremony unveiling a provincial historic site cairn, erected by the Department of Economic Affairs (Lethbridge Herald 1959Lethbridge Herald. 1959. Newspaper clipping, June 5. Glenbow Archives, M4442, file 3,
 [Google Scholar]
). The engraved text extended a familiar colonial narrative:

Sometime in the dim past a primitive people inscribed strange drawings of animals, men and symbols on the sandstone rocks. The first known white man to see them was James Doty in 1855. At that time the origin of these petroglyphs was unknown to the Blackfoot Indians who inhabited the area.

If the flimsy signs of the 1930s were occasionally contested by a wider awareness of Niitsitapi practices of place, the stone cairn with its bronzed history appeared to cement a discourse of displacement. 4
 4. The cairn was removed sometime in the 1980s, and was placed into storage. My thanks to the staff at Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park for locating it in order to photograph the inscription for me.

Indeed, the popular writings about Writing-on-Stone continued to stress its ‘ancient’ character, a strategy that overtly aligned with tourist interests. For the Medicine Hat News, Writing-on-Stone compared favourably with the dinosaur excavations in the Alberta Badlands, and was therefore deserving of government funds for development. The rock art probably came from a ‘prehistoric race’ and one ‘obviously of some culture’ (Medicine Hat News 1957). The Farm and Ranch Review went even further in its assessment, claiming that ‘[s]ome [archaeologists] have concluded that an earlier race – more intelligent than the Indian passed through the province or perished without leaving much trace of their existence’ (Balla 1957Balla, Joe. 1957. “Writing On Stone – a public park”. In Farm and Ranch Review (May): 18
 [Google Scholar]
). Even government publications stressed the ‘mystery’ of origins surrounding the rock art, reporting that amateur archaeologists had claimed that the inscriptions could even be Egyptian, Phoenician or the work of prehistoric cave men (Government of Alberta 1954Government of Alberta. 1954. Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park. Within Our Borders, February, 1: 2–3
 [Google Scholar]
).

The overall renewal of Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park in the 1950s and 1960s produced an uneasy tension between the desire to publicize the site for tourism and the ability to preserve it. As access to the park increased, so did vandalism and graffiti, which called forth increasing calls for strategies to protect the pictographs and petroglyphs. Archaeologist Richard Forbis mused about the possibility of creating latex moulds that could be fitted over the top of the petroglyphs to preserve them, a procedure that was attempted in the 1980s, but discontinued owing to concern over damage to the rock face (Forbis 1961Forbis, Richard. 1961. Letter to Selwyn Dewdney, December 11. Glenbow Archives, M9286, File 13,
 [Google Scholar]
; Klassen 2003bKlassen, Michael A. 2003b. Áísínai'pi submission report – Place, Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Unpublished report, Parks Canada,
 [Google Scholar]
, 73). A 1965 report suggested that, in places where cracks were occurring and rock falls might damage the petroglyphs, the ‘specimens should be recorded and photographed in their present context, then removed to a museum, or to a permanent protected display within the park’. Other sites should be sheltered from weather and vandalism by installing wood and concrete frames with a grilled front, even though doing so might ‘interfere with photography’ (Kidd 1965Kidd, R. S. 1965. Report on the archaeological, historical and geological resources of Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park. Unpublished report, Provincial Archives of Alberta, 75.603, Box 1, file 16,
 [Google Scholar]
, 6).

Questions of preservation thus spoke to the heart of what could and should be done to ‘manage’ Writing-on-Stone, both in and out of place. Should the rock art be removed from its place in order to preserve it, or covered over in place, obscuring its tourist potential? In between these two extreme preservationist strategies lay the question of reproductions, capturing the rock art through photographs, film or other media in order to abstract it for scientific and popular consumption. In fact, the first ‘scientific’ articles on Writing-on-Stone were written based on photographs of the site, rather than actual visits. 5
 5. In 1915, a palaeontologist with the Geological Survey of Canada, Charles M. Sternberg, photographed some of the sites and forwarded them to Harlan I. Smith (1935), an anthropologist who made sketches from the photographs and published his work in 1923 (Dempsey 1973; Klassen 2003a).

 Photographers and film crews routinely ‘captured’ the rock art; reports circulated that chalk or lipstick was applied to the petroglyphs in order to make them more visible for such reproductions (Liddell c. 1965).

However, these representational problems led the Glenbow Foundation, a private philanthropic organization based in Calgary, to adopt a different approach. In 1959, it hired artist Selwyn Dewdney to reproduce extensive portions of the rock art on a larger scale with strict attention to accuracy. Dewdney realized the limitations and distortions of photography, from the perspectives of both lens angles and the question of distinguishing shadow from light where irregularities in the rock surface or pigment occurred (Dewdney 1960Dewdney, Selwyn. 1960. Note on colour photographs. Glenbow Archives, M9286, file 49,
 [Google Scholar]
). Dewdney placed Japanese rice paper over the engravings, soaked it with a roller so that the paper clung to the rock surface, and then traced the markings with a Conté crayon ( Figure 2). The artist reproduced and rescaled the tracings to one-third, checking them against measurements and colour photographs taken on site (Dewdney 1964Dewdney, Selwyn. 1964. “Writings on stone along the Milk River”. In The Beaver 295(Winter): 22–9
 [Google Scholar]
, Figure 3). There were tensions, however, between the artistic rendition and reproducing the rock art accurately. Dewdney himself realized that, even though the tracings were more accurate than photographic prints because of their ability to take uneven surfaces into account, in the end, the ‘camera may more closely approximate the actual visual experience’ (Dewdney 1960Dewdney, Selwyn. 1960. Note on colour photographs. Glenbow Archives, M9286, file 49,
 [Google Scholar]
). Moreover, some at the Glenbow were critical of the line strokes, which left the impression that the sandstone was ‘gouged with irregular strokes’ rather than being evenly incised (Forbis 1961Forbis, Richard. 1961. Letter to Selwyn Dewdney, December 11. Glenbow Archives, M9286, File 13,
 [Google Scholar]
). A similar strategy was followed by anthropologist James D. Keyser for his 1977 study, which used felt-pen tracing on polyethylene sheets. For Keyser, the benefits were that the method required only a short time and little equipment to complete, and the final product could be ‘stored, used, and transported more easily than a rubbing or a casting’ (1977, 11).

The circulations and mobilizations of rock art reproductions were never entirely restricted to academic or scholarly study. Dewdney produced a selection of full-scale watercolours, which the Glenbow intended to use as part of its display at the annual Calgary Stampede, complete with a ‘pseudo-rock’ built especially for that purpose (Forbis 1961Forbis, Richard. 1961. Letter to Selwyn Dewdney, December 11. Glenbow Archives, M9286, File 13,
 [Google Scholar]
). They were also copied and engraved onto the new Alberta Provincial Museum and Archives building, which opened in Edmonton in 1967, over the strong objections of the director, R.C. Harrison. Harrison had complained that there was no preservation value in reproducing them on the outside wall, because the proposed engravings were far larger than the originals, and the sculptor has ‘artificially organized them to tell a story which is the creation of his own mind, not the Indians’’. Only a proper museum display, with individual figures installed on plaster or fibreglass, would offer ‘true preservation’ (Harrison 1965Harrison, R. C. 1965. Memo to P.B. Howard, November 22. Provincial Archives of Alberta, 71.172, Box 1, file 6
 [Google Scholar]
, emphasis in original).

Harrison's protestations went unheeded, and Dewdney's drawings served as the basis for an artistic treatment of the museum's outside wall ( Figure 4). Instead of being interpreted by cairns and plaques, the reproduced rock art now serves as a sign in itself, signalling the attachment of an ancient history to a provincial narrative of place. The wall castings affirmed the interpretive role of the museum, and situated the space as the proper site for expert interpretation.

Such cultural ‘place takings‘ were reinforced by the dominant archaeological view, which focused on surface markings abstracted from place. However, these assumptions were shifting by the 1990s, when the traditional focus upon taxonomies, typologies and classifications of particular figures and symbols was critiqued strongly by archaeologists and others for ignoring the phenomenology of being in place – of failing to see the significance of the sacred landscape of Áísínai'pi as primary to the experience of the markings that lie within (Klassen, 1995, 2003aKlassen, Michael A. 2003a. “Spirit images, medicine rocks: The rock art of Alberta”.

). In its submission to support the application for national historic site status in 2002, the Mookakin Cultural and Heritage Society articulated this fundamental difference in understanding:

Áísínai'pi is a sacred place because spirits are present in the valley. The cultural and spiritual significance of Áísínai'pi does not come from the presence of archaeological evidence or specific physical components. It doesn't matter how many rock art or archaeological sites are located at Áísínai'pi, or how they are described and catalogued. The landscape and our traditions make Áísínai'pi significant to the Niitsitapi.

The Society was well aware of the vast amount of inventories and cataloguing of ‘heritage components' at Áísínai'pi, which was recognized as useful for a ‘Western, academic understanding' (Klassen 2003bKlassen, Michael A. 2003b. Áísínai'pi submission report – Place, Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Unpublished report, Parks Canada,
 [Google Scholar]
). 6
 6. Jack Brink and Narcisse Blood (2008) caution that there is no singular Niitsitapi view on the question of preservation. Although some maintain that the weathering of the rock as part of a natural cycle which should not be interfered with (Klassen 2003b, 18; see also Nicholas 2009), there is increasing support among Elders for careful preservation methods when undertaken in close consultation with Aboriginal communities.

It was only in the 1990s that formal consultations with local First Nations were initiated by the provincial government in preparing a new management plan for Writing-on-Stone. Although the park had allowed access for ceremonial purposes for some time, government officials reported that discussions with the Kainaa sent a clear message that ‘the Blackfoot people have not felt welcome at the park’. As a result, provincial officials started to work towards more interpretive collaboration, recommended that a new visitor centre be developed with Aboriginal assistance, and proposed that the name of the park be amended to include Áísínai'pi (Alberta Environmental Protection 1997Alberta Environmental Protection. 1997. Management plan: Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park Prairie Region, Natural Resources Service, Department of Environmental Protection
 [Google Scholar]
). Although the official provincial park name did not change, cooperation with Parks Canada secured the recognition of Áísínai'pi as a National Historic Site in 2004, and a nomination to the UNESCO World Heritage List, under the name of Áísínai'pi – Writing-on-Stone, is under way.

Since 1997, the park's willingness to work with Blackfoot communities has dramatically reshaped and remade Writing-on-Stone; written out of place fifty years earlier, today the visitor's first experience of Áísínai'pi is shaped largely by Niitsitapi perspectives. However, the reinterpretation of Áísínai'pi as part of a wider sacred landscape which stretches across the border to include Kaytoyissiiksi (the Sweetgrass Hills) alarms some local residents, who feel alienated from the park because of their own lack of access to the campsites (often filled with campers from outside the community) and who fear that any wider recognition might open the door to First Nations land claims (Klassen 2002Klassen, Michael A. 2002. Áísínai'pi – Writing-On-Stone national historic site feasibility study, local community consultation Report prepared for Alberta Community Development on file with Parks Canada, Gatineau, QC
 [Google Scholar]
). 7
 7. In order to assuage such concerns, Parks Canada organized a meeting between the Kainaa and the local settler community, who came together for a BBQ and raft trip in 2003, the first formal meeting between the two groups since the park's 1957 official opening (Magne 2006).

The underlying tensions between Blackfoot understandings of Áísínai'pi, local settler histories of place, and western academic studies of rock art are not simply a dissonant heritage that can easily be accommodated by the rubric of place, or the Quebec Convention's ‘spirit of place’. There are fundamental ontological and epistemological issues that underlie one's sense of being in place: as the Mookaakin Cultural and Heritage Society notes, ‘These sites are uniquely important to us. They tell us that our ancient stories are true. They tell us that we belong to this place in a way that no other human being can’ (Klassen 2003bKlassen, Michael A. 2003b. Áísínai'pi submission report – Place, Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Unpublished report, Parks Canada,
 [Google Scholar]
, 17). The visitor centre narrative offers a sensitive presentation of a sacred landscape which can impart a sense of respect for Blackfoot perspectives and beliefs. However, the distinction between a ‘shared’ landscape and a ‘sacred’ landscape in the narrative is significant in acknowledging difference and avoiding the trivialization of Niitsitapi ways of knowing. As Keith Basso (1996) notes in his classic study of Western Apache place-making, a sense of place is presumed to be ‘everyone's possession’, but it ‘is not possessed by everyone in similar manner or like configuration’ (1996, 144).

Just 200 km north and west from Writing-on-Stone – Áísínai'pi is one of Alberta's earliest world heritage sites, Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump. Situated in the foothills west of the town of Fort Macleod, the seven-story provincial interpretive centre is embedded within a cliff, a short walk away from the main jump site ( Figure 5). Only about 10% of the building is visible from the outside and, early on, tourists complained about missing the building altogether when they drove by. Visitors to the interpretive centre are encouraged by Aboriginal guides to take an elevator to the top level to view the jump cliffs before coming back into the building. The interior exhibits are arranged in thematic layers from top to bottom, moving roughly in chronological order from Napi's 8
 8. Napi (Old Man) is a powerful figure in Blackfoot stories, who acted on impulse and caused chaos, but not out of malice. He is a reminder of the negative consequences of doing things the wrong way (Bastien 2004; Blackfoot Gallery Committee 2001).

 World (geography and ecology), Napi's People (‘prehistoric’ Plains people), The Buffalo Hunt, Cultures in Contact, and finally ending with Uncovering the Past, which includes a replica archaeological dig ( Figure 6) at the bottom of a cliff which has itself been replicated from a nearby ancillary jump. Thus, as the visitor moves down, the chronology becomes more recent – the exact opposite of archaeological ‘layering’ which uncovers more recent pasts in surface strata.

To the right, walking paths on both the top and the base of the cliff lead visitors to the jump site above and kill area below. The idea for situating the building inside the bedrock apparently came from a night of drinking between archaeologists Jack Brink and Charles Schweger (Brink 2008: 262).

The central position of the archaeological dig at the heart of the interpretive centre is fitting; for the past half-century, the very criteria for defining Head-Smashed-In as a heritage site was its archaeological significance. The evidence lies at the edge of the parking lot, where a 1959 cairn – from the same historic marker programme as Writing-on-Stone – sits almost forgotten. 9
 9. The provincial historic marker programme was initiated as part of the province's 1955 Golden Jubilee, celebrating 50 years as a province (Opp 2007). The buffalo jump was first identified as a significant site in 1955 and, in 1959, 20 concrete cairns with bronze plaques were erected across the province, including both ‘Early Man’ and Writing-on-Stone (Dempsey 1955; Bryant 1959).

 The text reads: ‘This site was excavated by a party from the University of New Mexico under Boyd Wettlaufer to become the first professional ‘dig’ in Alberta. The site revealed an upper cultural level of nomadic Blackfoot tribes and an earlier level of civilization dating back about 3,000 years.' Officially known in the 1950s as ‘Early Man Provincial Park Historical Site’, the buffalo jump remained on private ranching land except for a one-acre parcel set apart for the cairn, but its public designation and close road access led to a dramatic increase in amateur collectors hunting for arrowheads and other artefacts (Galliver 1965Galliver, W T. 1965. Letter to R. Forbis, January 11. Glenbow Archives, M9286, Box 2, File 21,
 [Google Scholar]
).

Concerned about the intrusions of amateurs, the Glenbow lobbied the land owner to help restrict access to the jump site and launched its own ‘professional’ expedition in association with the University of Calgary in 1965. Even in the middle of these excavations the professional archaeologist on site reported that he still had to drive away the ‘pot hunters’ who continued to visit in the early mornings and on weekends (Mattie 1966Mattie, W. C. 1966. Letter to R.O. Harrison, August 26. Provincial Archives of Alberta, 71.172,
 [Google Scholar]
). Newspaper coverage from that summer was carefully calibrated to encourage support for scientific principles and discourage ‘lootings’. Reporters also carried a new narrative that reframed the buffalo jump as being not just the site of the first ‘professional’ dig in Alberta (a fact almost never mentioned in press coverage of the mid-1960s); rather, its new significance lay in the impressive age of the artefacts recovered, as seen in the headlines proclaiming: ‘3,000-year-old Buffalo Jump Uncovered’ (Lyttik 1965Lyttik, George. 1965. 3,000-year-old buffalo jump uncovered. Albertan, July 31. Newspaper Clipping Scrapbook, Glenbow Archives, M2105,
 [Google Scholar]
). Although it was known by many names, including ‘Spring Point Buffalo Jump’ and ‘Fort Macleod Buffalo Jump’, the scientific studies of the area attached a new moniker to the place. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump seemed to capture the qualities of ancientness that fired the imaginations of many who wanted to develop the site as both an area protected from collectors and a tourist attraction. A portion of the land was donated to the provincial government in 1966, but little development occurred and unauthorized digging continued well into the 1970s.

By the end of the decade, the provincial government had moved away from historical markers and started to develop a small number of larger interpretive centres for meeting both cultural heritage and tourist needs. Consultants were hired to develop an interpretive concept plan (Makale & Kyllo Planning Associates 1980), and the Archaeological Society of Alberta took the lead in preparing a nomination for UNESCO World Heritage status, which was approved in 1981. However, if the UNESCO status declared the site to have ‘outstanding universal value’ for the world, neighbouring Blackfoot communities did not necessarily agree. The jump site lies only a few hundred metres from Piikáni reserve land, but the Blackfoot nations had not been consulted by either the planners or the archaeologists preparing the nomination. Although the jump was well known, its significance within Blackfoot oral tradition was far less than other comparable sites such as Áísínai'pi and another buffalo jump, Kipitáákii Písskaan (Women's Buffalo Jump). Indeed, Head-Smashed-In is nowhere to be found if one views the map of ‘sacred geography’ from the Writing-on-Stone/Áísínai'pi visitor centre.

For archaeologists, however, Head-Smashed-In represented the oldest known buffalo jump on the continent, and one that demonstrated a remarkable continuity of use. In order to represent visually the ‘objective’ significance of the site, the UNESCO nomination package included a detailed ‘comparative matrix analysis’, which assigned numerical ratings to categories in a table comparing Head-Smashed-In with eight other buffalo jumps in Canada and the US. The categories used were almost entirely aesthetic (‘Visual Definition’, ‘Height of Drop’, ‘Nature of Drop’, ‘Cultural Disturbance’) or focused on the nature of the objects found (‘Linear Extent’, ‘Stratigraphic Quality’, ‘Time Span’, ‘Cultural Phases’, ‘Artifact Yield’, ‘Artifact Diversity’). A total of 60 different numerical assessments (divided into separate comparisons of kill sites, camp sites and gathering basins) were assigned for each jump in the table, and invariably Women’s Buffalo Jump fared poorly compared with Head-Smashed-In. For the latter, ‘Historic Quality’, ‘Interpretive Value’, ‘Heritage Value’ and ‘Scientific Value’ all received a top score of ‘3’ (excellent) compared with Women's Buffalo Jump, which could only manage a ‘1’ (poor) in all these categories. Only in a few rare categories, such as ‘Ethnic Value’’ (which was never defined) could the two jumps tie in numerical relevance. As Tainter and Bagley note in their study of American archaeology and cultural resource management, ‘The larger, deeper, older, or richer a site, the more likely it will be considered worthy of study or preservation’ (2008, 61).

Such categories of significance reflected professional developments within archaeology itself, which increasingly adopted ‘scientific principles’ in site assessment, driven by the positivist assumptions of processual theory and the search for ‘universal laws’. As Laurajane Smith (2005Smith, Laurajane. 2005. “Archaeological significance and the governance of identity in cultural heritage management”. In Heritage of value, archaeology of renown, Edited by: Mathers, C., Darvill, T. and Little, B. Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida.
 [Google Scholar]
) notes, proponents of the ‘New Archaeology’ of the 1970s and early-1980s were at pains to distinguish themselves from amateur diggers, and repeatedly declared that a state of crisis was at hand. These discourses legitimized archaeological access to place and material culture, and reaffirmed archaeological expertise in the cultural management of heritage. However, once planning for the Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump interpretive centre started in the 1980s, archaeologists started to consult local communities, including nearby First Nations. As archaeologist Jack Brink admits freely in his recently published book reflecting on his work and experience at Head-Smashed-In: ‘I entered the Head-Smashed-In project with all the training of a scientist who studied the dead and none of the preparation needed to deal with the living. The learning curve was steep and sometimes rocky’ (Brink 2008Brink, Jack and Narcisse Blood. 2008. “Perspectives on rock art: Conservation at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, Alberta”. In Preserving Aboriginal heritage: Technical and traditional approaches, Edited by: Carole, Dignard. Ottawa: Canadian Conservation Institute.
 [Google Scholar]
). 10
10. By framing this paper around contested histories of place, I realize that I have allowed little room for acknowledging how archaeology itself has been transformed in the twenty-first century by new approaches that are far more responsive to Aboriginal concerns, epistemologies and collaborations (Colwell-Chanthaphonh and Ferguson 2008). Nor do I address Aboriginal appropriations of archaeological methods, such as Eldon Yellowhorn's call for an ‘internalist archaeology’ (Yellowhorn 2006).

One of the first points of contention Brink faced was the question of the name. Piikáni oral traditions do recount the story of a young man who wanted to watch buffalo being herded over the cliff from beneath the ledge, but the prosperous hunt produced such a pile of bodies that his skull was crushed against the rocks by the weight of the carcasses. However, many elders believe that the story refers to another jump further north, not to the neighbouring one now called Head-Smashed-In. Brink recalls being lectured repeatedly on this point, how ‘we got the wrong name for this place’ (Brink 2008Brink, Jack and Narcisse Blood. 2008. “Perspectives on rock art: Conservation at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, Alberta”. In Preserving Aboriginal heritage: Technical and traditional approaches, Edited by: Carole, Dignard. Ottawa: Canadian Conservation Institute.
 [Google Scholar]
, 26). Provincial officials could point to archival evidence of nineteenth-century maps and other vague references that had accumulated about a place where heads or skulls were smashed (Byrne 1983Byrne, W. J. 1983. Memo to Jean Brown re. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump plaque, May 3. Provincial Archives of Alberta, 89.433 Box 4, file 6-2-10, vol., : 2
 [Google Scholar]
), but such references were not specific enough to conclude exactly which jump might have carried the specific story associated with Head-Smashed-In. By the mid-1980s, it was too late to change the name, given the advanced state of the project and its position on the World Heritage List – indeed, the uniqueness of the name itself was repeatedly commented upon. But the question of the authority behind the name was also an epistemological claim, a testing of the value of oral tradition against the scientific claims of archaeology and the historical claims of the archive. If the wrong name had to stand for strategic political and economic reasons, the Piikáni ensured that they affirmed their own narratives of landscape and geography against the cartographical assumptions imposed by outside experts.

As planning for Head-Smashed-In continued, the provincial government decided to hold a celebration for the World Heritage Site designation in the fall of 1983. While the building was still years away from construction, a bronze plaque was commissioned for unveiling ( Figure 7). The English text was written first and sent out for translation into French and Blackfoot. However, in reviewing the text, Piikáni elders insisted on adding a sentence, ‘Naapiikoaiksi ipahtsiinihkatoomiaawa amo pisskani’ [White people incorrectly named this buffalo jump]. Government officials quickly objected to such a public admission of error, and the debate over the wording caused considerable difficulties (Byrne 1983Byrne, W. J. 1983. Memo to Jean Brown re. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump plaque, May 3. Provincial Archives of Alberta, 89.433 Box 4, file 6-2-10, vol., : 2
 [Google Scholar]
). Eventually a compromise was reached by rephrasing the additional sentence as ‘Speakers of Blackfoot call it “Buffalo Jump”’. The final version acknowledged multiple perspectives in the naming of the particular site at hand, rather than addressing the wider context of conflicting geographical understandings.

What received much less notice – both at the time and in the years since – is just how different the overarching narrative of the Blackfoot text is compared with the English and French versions. Instead of describing the site as being of ‘outstanding universal value’ for having been used by ‘at least four successive Indian cultures over 5,700 years’, the literal Blackfoot text refers to UNESCO as a committee which decided ‘that it was very important this buffalo jump. So they would know about the past people who lived among buffalo’ (translation provided in Byrne 1983Byrne, W. J. 1983. Memo to Jean Brown re. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump plaque, May 3. Provincial Archives of Alberta, 89.433 Box 4, file 6-2-10, vol., : 2
 [Google Scholar]
). In recasting the description of Head-Smashed-In, the Piikáni made visible the authority of ‘heritage’ to make place significant for some, and countered with their own refusal to accept the name or the history ascribed to it. This epistemic challenge continued throughout the consultations for the interpretive centre themes and exhibits. The Piikáni rejected invitations to participate as simply one component of a broad ‘group of experts’ who were commenting on the plans. Although one person from the band was appointed to the official Advisory Board, provincial officials still had to arrange private meetings in order to keep the process moving. Heritage officials anticipated that concerns would be raised over statements in the evolving ‘interpretive matrix’ which suggested that the Piikáni were ‘relatively recent immigrants’ to the area, and worked to ‘cleverly balance’ the exhibit with oral tradition (Tracy 1983Tracy, W. A. 1983. Memo to Review Committee, re Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump Interpretive Programme, November 17. PAA 89.433, 6.2.10, Box 4, vol. 3
 [Google Scholar]
; Clarke 1984). 11
11. A similar epistemological struggle is outlined by Narcisse Blood and Cynthia Chambers (2009) in their discussion of Óóhkotok, a Blackfoot sacred place also designated as a provincial historic site, located south of Calgary. Here, the Blackfoot narrative of Napi is displayed in italics, while the regular text offers a geological explanation for how a glacial erratic came to rest on the prairie. The typographic design thus distinguishes ‘fictional story from factual text’ and functions in a way that signals to the public ‘which story is universal and true, and which is particular and cultural, which is to be believed and which is not, which informs and which entertains’ (2009, 268).

Brink (2008Brink, Jack and Narcisse Blood. 2008. “Perspectives on rock art: Conservation at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, Alberta”. In Preserving Aboriginal heritage: Technical and traditional approaches, Edited by: Carole, Dignard. Ottawa: Canadian Conservation Institute.
 [Google Scholar]
) notes with regret the failure to consult with other nations outside the Piikáni; the Kainaa in particular, with reserve land located only 50 kilometres to the southeast, felt excluded from the planning of Head-Smashed-In. Nevertheless, within the context of the 1980s, the level of Aboriginal involvement in developing the site was unprecedented within Canada, and certainly this experience played a large role in shaping the later consultations, especially for the Kainaa, in planning for the Writing-on-Stone/Áísínai'pi Visitor Centre. Moreover, Head-Smashed-In was, and is, a major provincial site which is economically and politically significant for both the Piikáni and the Kainaa. Many people from both communities found summer employment on the archaeological excavation crews and in the interpretive centre itself, where all guides are required to have the ability to speak Blackfoot.

Consultation and employment alone, however, do not necessarily produce place as meaningful. At its centre, Head-Smashed-In is an archaeological site with a historical narrative of plains Aboriginal life grafted on top. The search for a deeper meaning ran through many of the planning documents; early designs for the site encouraged the production of listening stations where the ‘spirit of the buffalo’ would speak, so that ‘Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump will be perceived by the public as being a special and spiritual place’ (Makale and Kyllo 1980, 68), a strategy that was wisely avoided. However, the active involvement of the Piikáni recast the significance of place in some unexpected ways.

As Jack Brink recounts, the most visible symbol of Head-Smashed-In is a striking ceremonial painted buffalo head, filled with sweetgrass. Although it was intended to be a replica specifically for display in the interpretive centre, Piikáni elders insisted that only those with the proper spiritual authority could recreate such objects. 12

 Under these conditions, reproductions became more than simply copies; they were powerful objects in their own right. The buffalo head, in particular, was prepared by elder Joe Crowshoe and has been used in ceremonies inside and outside the centre. It cannot be removed from its case except by those with the authority to handle such an object. The very use of the skull in promotional material produced considerable debate, and while posters and billboards have been allowed, printing the image on other touristic items (such as T-shirts) are denied, as this is viewed as being disrespectful (Brink 2008Brink, Jack and Narcisse Blood. 2008. “Perspectives on rock art: Conservation at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, Alberta”. In Preserving Aboriginal heritage: Technical and traditional approaches, Edited by: Carole, Dignard. Ottawa: Canadian Conservation Institute.
 [Google Scholar]
, 279–81). For most visitors, however, the current and continuing significance of the buffalo skull is obscured by the historical frame of the exhibit, which displays a wide variety of traditional objects created from different parts of the buffalo. The text offers only a brief description and, for most visitors, its location within the ‘Buffalo Hunt’ thematic layer implies a quality of pastness, rather than emphasizing very real present concerns and attachments.

If Head-Smashed-In pales in comparison with Áísínai'pi in relation to Niitsitapi sacred geography, we should not ignore the strategic practices of place that have made Head-Smashed-In increasingly significant, even if it is wrongly named. When two tourists died of heart attacks soon after the building opened, the staff insisted on closing the facility in order to allow cleansing ceremonies to take place (Brink 2008Brink, Jack and Narcisse Blood. 2008. “Perspectives on rock art: Conservation at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, Alberta”. In Preserving Aboriginal heritage: Technical and traditional approaches, Edited by: Carole, Dignard. Ottawa: Canadian Conservation Institute.
 [Google Scholar]
, 292). Most of the key displays have not changed a great deal since the 1980s, but the one area that has received a considerable amount of renewal is the final exhibit area, which has been expanded to include much more contemporary information about nearby First Nations. Although it is an area that is not officially recognized in brochures or maps of the centre, the changing final panels attempt to make the present a visible part of the past.

On my most recent visit, a temporary exhibit of photographs lined the back wall of the ground floor. It is a visual repatriation project, ‘Lost Identities’, which brings photographs out of the archives and back to the communities where they were taken. Acknowledging that the Aboriginal subjects had no say in the taking of their pictures, the project asks for public help in identifying people, events and places, to ‘rediscover their voices’. The modern photographic archive serves as a repository for repeated ‘place-takings’, but the interpretive centre is now the site of a return. The explanatory text asks the audience to help ‘the pictures and the people in the pictures speak for themselves’. Head-Smashed-In was developed as a site based squarely on its ‘universal value’ as ‘tangible’ heritage, the materiality of its archaeological remains guiding its value in UNESCO's eyes in the 1980s. And yet it has been the subsequent practice of place by elders and staff that has mobilized a meaningful sense of place or an ‘intangible’ cultural heritage. The evolution of these parallel paths was not planned by heritage officials, nor does ‘heritage’ itself bridge these two worlds, although being ‘in place’ does allow for interesting overlaps. If the Niitsitapi investment in Head-Smashed-In has made it more than simply an archaeological site, one cannot ignore or avoid the meaningful resistance encountered in transforming a plot of ranchland into a provincial and world heritage site. As the bronze plaque testifies, even in its more reconciliatory version, Head-Smashed-In still remains a place wrongly named.

Conclusion
Writing in 2001, David Glassberg suggested that ‘orientation to place’ is what separates ‘academic from public history’, since the former starts with social or political processes and then proceeds to ask questions of where they occurred, while the public historian begins with a meaningful place and asks ‘What happened here?’ (Glassberg 2001Glassberg, David. 2001. Sense of history: The place of the past in American Life, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press.
 [Google Scholar]
, 111). A decade later, ‘place’ is indeed a crowded place, with historians, archaeologists, geographers, sociologists and heritage professionals all staking their claims. However, as place has moved from being more than just a location and starts to accrue dimensions of identity and even psychology, one needs to be cautious about totalizing the experience of place. If heritage discourse simply moves from the tangible to the intangible without making itself and its dissonances visible, it risks adding layers of meaning while simultaneously obscuring the social and cultural processes at work. Heritage place-making has its own histories, and these stories are important to tell because of the very disruptions and fragments of place that they reveal. By casting a critical eye on these processes, I do not want to ‘secularize’ the landscape or deny the very real and deep attachments to place that are connoted by notions of a ‘spirit of place’. I do, however, want to question how overarching heritage visions of a ‘spirit of place’ might obscure other spatial histories which point to moments of fragmentation and abstraction.

Jeff Malpas points to the ‘obscurity of place’ as always being beyond our reach, and therefore

To become familiar with a place, to learn to inhabit it, is not to dispel its secrets, nor to render it into some simply intelligible form – as if the place could be transformed into a sign, an idea, a mere position – it is to work oneself into that place, to take in its rhythms and movements, to become part of them, and for them to become part of one's self. (Malpas 2008Malpas, Jeff. 2008. “Repetitions”.

)

In southern Alberta, the practice of public history is also a practice of place, and the very geography of Alberta is a hybrid landscape of colonial and aboriginal pasts. Perhaps instead of an essentialized heritage, a singular ‘spirit of place’, we need to pay attention to the mobilities, ‘the rhythms and movements’, the processes of ‘making’ and ‘taking’ place. Reconciling one's own relationship to places deemed to be of heritage significance requires that one confronts these contentious histories and processes, and makes them visible.

Notes
 1. Niitsitapi/Niitsitapiiski, ‘Real or True Person/People’, is a word that can apply to all Aboriginal peoples (Bastien 2004). It is also sometimes used as a term of reference for Blackfoot-speaking nations, which include the Siksika (Blackfoot), the Kainaa (Blood), the Piikáni (North Peigan or Apatohsipiikani) and the Blackfeet (South Piegan or Amsskaapipiikani) in Montana, especially in public exhibitionary contexts such as the Glenbow Museum's Niitsitapiisini exhibit (glenbow.org/blackfoot and The Blackfoot Gallery Committee 2001). A more cultural sense of the word is as ‘a term designating how Blackfoot recognize themselves, through their socio-cultural practices, laws, and relationships with the Creator as distinct from other people who do not share those practices’ (Noble 2008). However, adopting Blackfoot words into English raises many contextual issues. There are variations in how the singular and plural forms are used within an English text, and other words with a more geographically specific meaning are also used to denote Blackfoot-speaking nations or people, such as Siksiksaitsitapi (Bastien 2004) or Siksikáítapiiksi (Blood and Chambers 2009). My thanks to Narcisse Blood and Cynthia (2009) Chambers for responding to my enquiries on the usage of these terms. To avoid confusion, I have tended to use either Niitsitapi or Blackfoot, because these are the terms most often used in public exhibition and interpretive contexts. However, any errors or omissions in using Blackfoot terms are entirely my own.

 2. The Mookaakin Heritage and Cultural Society was formed in 1998 and is affiliated with the Kainai Nation. Led by members of traditional Kainaa cultural and spiritual societies, it promotes traditional Kainaa observances, language and history, encourages public appreciation for Kainaa culture, and is actively involved in the repatriation of ceremonial objects and artefacts (Klassen 2003b; Conaty 2008; Bell, Statt, and the Mookakin Cultural Society 2008).

 3. Rodeos have been hosted at Writing-on-Stone since 1966, but the corrals have been maintained by the local Writing-On-Stone Riding Association since the late-1950s (Hughson 1983). Michael Klassen notes that, during the 1960s and 1970s, when the ceremonial use of Áísínai'pi was at its lowest, many Blackfoot people still visited as part of the annual rodeo (2005, 37).

 4. The cairn was removed sometime in the 1980s, and was placed into storage. My thanks to the staff at Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park for locating it in order to photograph the inscription for me.

 5. In 1915, a palaeontologist with the Geological Survey of Canada, Charles M. Sternberg, photographed some of the sites and forwarded them to Harlan I. Smith (1935), an anthropologist who made sketches from the photographs and published his work in 1923 (Dempsey 1973; Klassen 2003a).

 6. Jack Brink and Narcisse Blood (2008) caution that there is no singular Niitsitapi view on the question of preservation. Although some maintain that the weathering of the rock as part of a natural cycle which should not be interfered with (Klassen 2003b, 18; see also Nicholas 2009), there is increasing support among Elders for careful preservation methods when undertaken in close consultation with Aboriginal communities.

 7. In order to assuage such concerns, Parks Canada organized a meeting between the Kainaa and the local settler community, who came together for a BBQ and raft trip in 2003, the first formal meeting between the two groups since the park's 1957 official opening (Magne 2006).

 8. Napi (Old Man) is a powerful figure in Blackfoot stories, who acted on impulse and caused chaos, but not out of malice. He is a reminder of the negative consequences of doing things the wrong way (Bastien 2004; Blackfoot Gallery Committee 2001).

 9. The provincial historic marker programme was initiated as part of the province's 1955 Golden Jubilee, celebrating 50 years as a province (Opp 2007). The buffalo jump was first identified as a significant site in 1955 and, in 1959, 20 concrete cairns with bronze plaques were erected across the province, including both ‘Early Man’ and Writing-on-Stone (Dempsey 1955; Bryant 1959).

10. By framing this paper around contested histories of place, I realize that I have allowed little room for acknowledging how archaeology itself has been transformed in the twenty-first century by new approaches that are far more responsive to Aboriginal concerns, epistemologies and collaborations (Colwell-Chanthaphonh and Ferguson 2008). Nor do I address Aboriginal appropriations of archaeological methods, such as Eldon Yellowhorn's call for an ‘internalist archaeology’ (Yellowhorn 2006).

11. A similar epistemological struggle is outlined by Narcisse Blood and Cynthia Chambers (2009) in their discussion of Óóhkotok, a Blackfoot sacred place also designated as a provincial historic site, located south of Calgary. Here, the Blackfoot narrative of Napi is displayed in italics, while the regular text offers a geological explanation for how a glacial erratic came to rest on the prairie. The typographic design thus distinguishes ‘fictional story from factual text’ and functions in a way that signals to the public ‘which story is universal and true, and which is particular and cultural, which is to be believed and which is not, which informs and which entertains’ (2009, 268).
