Abstract
The collection and circulation of data is now a central element of increasingly more sectors of contemporary capitalism.
This article analyses data as a form of capital that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data collection is
driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a universe in
which everything is made of data. The imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible influences
many key decisions about business models, political governance, and technological development. This article argues that
many common practices of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of data extraction, wherein data is
taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By understanding data as a form capital, we can better analyse the
meaning, practices, and implications of datafication as a political economic regime.

Introduction
Data has become central and essential for increasingly
more sectors of contemporary capitalism. Industries
focused on technology, infrastructure, ﬁnance, manufacturing, insurance, and energy are now treating data
as a form of capital. No longer is data just a concern of
scientists or a by-product of other processes. Until
recently, companies simply deleted data or chose not
to collect it because paying for storage did not seem
like a good investment (Oracle and MIT Technology
Review Custom, 2016). Now, though, companies are
clamouring to collect data – as much as they can, wherever they can. For the increasing number of companies
participating in the ‘data economy’ or ‘digital economy,’ deleting data because of storage costs would be
like burning piles of money or dumping barrels of oil

down the drain because renting a warehouse was too
much trouble. While data is not the same as proﬁt, they
share a similar logic. Just as we expect corporations to
be proﬁt-driven, we should now expect organisations to
be data-driven; that is, the drive to accumulate data
now propels new ways of doing business and governance. It is a key factor in major corporate decisions,
such as Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods for
$13.7 billion (Stevens and Haddon, 2017), and of government policies such as investment in urban sensor
networks (Heinzmann, 2014). Indeed, as The
Economist (2017b) has noted, ‘Industrial giants such
as GE and Siemens now sell themselves as data
ﬁrms.’ In short, data – and the accumulation of data
– is a core component of political economy in the 21st
century.

As a paradigm and logic, the idea of data-as-capital
aﬀects and transforms many spaces and sectors.
Thanks to technologies like the Internet of Things,
online platforms, and data analytics the list of things
that now count as ‘digital products and services’ – and
hence what counts as part of the digital economy – is
growing at a rapid pace (Srnicek, 2016). This, in turn,
means that data is a foundational form of capital for
everything from the ‘smart home’ to the ‘smart city,’
ﬁnance to governance, production to distribution, consumer devices to enterprise systems, and much more
(Kitchin, 2014). Without data, many of these technologies and organisations would not be able to operate,
let alone be able to generate value.
This article contributes to the study of data within
contemporary capitalism by analysing data as a form of
capital. The existing literature on the social, political
and economic dimensions of data treats data as a commodity. Whether implicitly or explicitly, analyses in
both academic and media outlets typically take this
analytical frame as a given. Yet, as this article makes
clear, the distinction between capital and commodity is
important and we cannot assume data is always a commodity. By understanding data as a form of capital, we
can better analyse the nature and dynamics of digital
capitalism. Rather than data collection being seen as
simply a way of producing and obtaining commodities
that are somehow converted into monetary value, dataﬁcation takes shape as a political economic regime
driven by the logic of perpetual (data) capital accumulation and circulation. Framing data as a form of capital casts new light on the imperatives motivating
contemporary organisations, the ways value can be
derived from data, and the normative importance of
data extraction.

Data-driven capitalism
There are now a variety of labels that refer to the political economic relationship between data and capitalism, such as ‘surveillance capitalism’ (Foster and
McChesney, 2014; Zuboﬀ, 2015), ‘informational capitalism’ (Fuchs, 2010), ‘communicative capitalism’
(Dean, 2005), ‘platform capitalism’ (Srnicek, 2016)
and ‘iCapitalism’ (Duﬀ, 2016). These diﬀerent labels
are not interchangeable, but they do share common
themes and conclusions. This paper builds on three
broad insights from the growing literature on critical
political economy of data: (1) data is valuable and
value-creating (Arvidsson, 2016; Roderick, 2014;
Srnicek, 2016); (2) data collection has a pervasive,
powerful inﬂuence over how businesses and governments behave (Bouk, forthcoming; Fourcade and
Healy, 2017; Zuboﬀ, 2016); and (3) data systems are
rife with relations of inequity, extraction, and

Big Data & Society
exploitation (Aitken, 2017; Andrejevic, 2014;
Fourcade and Healy, 2013; Poon, 2016; Thatcher
et al., 2016).
Fourcade and Healy (2017) have argued that
‘modern organisations’ are now driven by a ‘data
imperative’ that demands the extraction of all data,
from all sources, by any means possible. ‘Storing and
studying people’s everyday activities, even the seemingly mundane, has become the default rather than
the exception’ (Angwin and Valentino-Devries, 2012:
n.p.). Fulﬁlling the data imperative involves more
than just passively collecting data; it means actively
creating data (IBM, 2014). This entails the (total) dataﬁcation and surveillance of people, places, processes,
things, and relationships among them (van Dijck,
2014). Cisco, one of the companies building this allencompassing system, calls it ‘the Internet of
Everything.’ Similarly, IBM states that, ‘Everything is
made of data these days’ (IBM, 2014).
What does it mean to see the world in a way that
asserts everything is data? This is not just a neutral
observation about the nature or substance of the
world. Such statements do not merely reveal or reﬂect
the world. They order and construct the world (Boyd
and Crawford, 2012; Kitchin et al., 2015). By operating
rhetorically (Rosenberg, 2013), they change how we
understand and interact with the world, and they put
those with data capital in a position of access and
authority. They establish the context through which
accumulation and use of data not only occurs, but
becomes a driving logic that inﬂuences behaviour.
They perform the power/knowledge relationship: to
know the world is to exercise power over it and to exercise power is to know it – to examine its features and
characteristics, to sort it into categories and norms, to
render it legible and observable, to exclude other metrics and methods of knowing it (Bowker and Star,
2000).
Data mining is a misleading name; a more apt term
would be data manufacturing. Data is not out there
waiting to be discovered as if it already exists in the
world like crude oil and raw ore (Gitelman, 2013).
Data is a recorded abstraction of the world
created and valorised by people using technology. The
framing of data as a natural resource that is everywhere
and free for the taking reinforces regimes of data
accumulation. A 2014 video by Siemens, a major industrial manufacturer, illustrates the logic of the data
imperative:
‘We live in a universe of data that gains not only in
volume, but importance, every day. The question of
how to generate business value from it becomes more
and more essential to us. We need to understand that
data is everywhere, and it is generated every second of

Sadowski
the day. We need to understand data as an asset – and
turn it into a value.’ (2014)

It is not a coincidence that data is treated as a universal substance right at the time when there is so much
to gain for whoever can lay claim to that data and
extract it from every source. Indeed, there is a feedback
loop: many control systems rely on the constant gathering and processing of data, and in turn those control
systems enable more data to be generated (Sadowski
and Pasquale, 2015). Flows of data correspond to
ﬂows of power and proﬁt, thus the alchemy of dataﬁcation promises to produce inﬁnite reserves of both. At
the same time, the rhetoric of universality reframes
everything as within the domain of surveillance/platform/digital capitalism.
The goal of transforming everything into data and
the search for new sources of data echoes imperialist
modes of accumulation (Luxemburg, 1951; Thatcher
et al., 2016). In short, as capitalism faces crises of accumulation, there is a need to ﬁnd new sources of value
and new places to oﬄoad goods. ‘Old strategies of
accumulation are re-attempted in new spaces and new
strategies are crafted through trial and error in the
never-ending quest to surpass or displace the internal
contradictions which lead to crisis’ (Greene and Joseph,
2015: 224). This could mean subjecting previously noncommodiﬁed and non-monetised parts of life to the
logic of capitalism or colonising new territories so
they are brought into the global capitalist web as sites
of extraction (Moore, 2015). We can see this dynamic
of ‘data colonialism’ when technology corporations like
Facebook and Google move into territories like India
and Africa (Thatcher et al., 2016). They do so under the
guise of providing subsidised services that connect marginalised people to the Internet, yet the companies also
beneﬁt greatly by opening markets, locking people into
their platforms, and tapping sources of data (Solon,
2017). These new places with new people provide new
opportunities for data accumulation. The same imperialist tactics are being replayed now, but updated for the
digital age.
As we can see, this growing body of research on
critical data studies (Dalton et al., 2016) has shown
how the production, distribution, and use of data is
situated within an emerging political economy that
has wide-ranging implications across society: from the
restructuring of cities and the state (Kitchin et al., 2015;
Leszczynski, 2012), to the (re)development of electrical
and computational infrastructure (Levenda et al., 2016;
Pickren, 2018). Equipped with the ﬁndings of this literature, this paper can be seen as a call to go back to
basics by further analysing foundational questions in
the political economy of data: What is the economic
form of data? How can value be derived from data?

3
Why does data collection matter? Opening back up
these questions, I argue, productively reframes how
we understand the form and dynamics of data.

Data capital
The ‘Big Data strategist’ for Oracle, one of the largest
software companies in the world, has said, ‘Data is in
fact a new kind of capital on par with ﬁnancial capital
for creating new products and services. And it’s not just
a metaphor; data fulﬁls the literal textbook deﬁnition of
capital.’ (OracleANZ, 2015). This statement points to
an emerging political economic shift in which data is
created, collected, and circulated as capital. The previous section described how data has been critically analysed in the context of capitalism – implicitly or
explicitly – as a commodity. However, as businesses
and government bodies begin treating data as capital,
there is a need for examining the characteristics and
dynamics of ‘data capital.’ This section aims to do so
by ﬁrst reviewing two theories of capital, from Karl
Marx and Pierre Bourdieu, then using them to analyse
data.
In Capital, Volume 1, Marx describes capital as a
relationship between money (M) and commodities
(C); namely, the ways they circulate and transform,
which he simpliﬁes into two general formulas. The
ﬁrst formula represents consumption, C-M-C: a commodity is sold for money which is then used to buy
another commodity. Therefore, C-M-C is the cycle of
using money to turn one qualitatively diﬀerent thing
(e.g. labour power) into another qualitatively diﬀerent
thing (e.g. coﬀee). The cycle of consumption is motivated by the use-value of a commodity and it is completed when money is turned into a commodity.
The second formula represents capital, M-C-M0 :
money is used to buy a commodity which is then sold
for more money. ‘The value [of money] originally
advanced, therefore, not only remains intact while in
circulation but increases its magnitude, adds to itself a
surplus-value, or is valorised. And this movement converts it into capital’ (Marx, 1990: 252). The cycle of
capital is motivated by exchange-value and the cycle
does not complete because capital requires continuous
circulation. When money is turned into a commodity
for consumption, rather than invested to make proﬁt, it
ceases to be capital. In addition to ‘money capital’ (i.e.,
invested funds), Marx distinguishes between two forms
of ‘real capital’ employed in the creation of surplus
value. Constant capital is the means of production for
commodities (i.e., factories, machinery, raw materials,
etc.). Variable capital is the means of subsistence for
labour power (i.e., the costs of hiring workers).
Expanding on Marx’s foundational analysis,
Bourdieu theorized two new forms of capital that are

4
distinct from what he terms economic capital, ‘which is
immediately and directly convertible into money and
may be institutionalized in the form of property
rights’ (1986: 242). The other forms Bourdieu theorized, cultural capital and social capital, stand alone
in their own right while also being ‘convertible, in certain conditions, into economic capital’ (p. 242). They
are, at their root, ‘transformed, disguised forms of economic capital’ (p. 251).
Cultural capital contributes to a person’s status and
success in ways that go beyond the idea of ‘human capital,’ which focuses on monetary investment in education and skills. Cultural capital is a representation of
class and tends to be invested by a person’s family and
transmitted from a person’s domestic environment.
Bourdieu (1986) identiﬁes three types of cultural capital: embodied (e.g. character traits), objectiﬁed (e.g. art
collection), and institutionalised (university degree).
Social capital, according to Bourdieu (p. 248), ‘is the
aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are
linked to possession of a durable network of more or
less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.’ This form of capital accrues by
being included in privileged groups, whether that means
being inducted through rites of passage (e.g. fraternal
orders) or through rites of inheritance (e.g. noble lineage). When people talk about the value of ‘who you
know’ and ‘networking,’ they are talking about having
and developing social capital.
Building from Marx, we can now frame two
common analyses of data in terms of a debate about
what economic form data represents. On one hand,
data is cast as a digital raw material – constant capital
– necessary in the production of commodities. It is hard
to read media articles and business reports about data
without seeing it called ‘the new oil.’ For instance, the
cover of a 2017 issue of The Economist (2017b) proclaims ‘The World’s Most Valuable Resource’ above
an illustration of oﬀshore oil platforms labelled with
the names of major digital platforms like Facebook,
Google, and Uber presumably drilling into an ocean
of data. On the other hand, data is cast as a commodity
produced by the digital labour of people posting on
Facebook, clicking on Google, exercising with Fitbits,
and all the other things we do that create data and that
data is created about (Fuchs, 2014; Till, 2012). The
cliché about the ‘free’ services provided digital platforms is that, ‘If you’re not the customer, you’re the
product.’1 Through the work of using platforms and
devices, people are turned into commodities that take
the form of personal data, which is sold to advertisers
and data brokers. In the age of mass media, this was
termed the ‘audience commodity’ (Smythe, 1981). Now
with social media it is called the ‘data double’ among
other coinages (Haggerty and Ericson, 2000).

Big Data & Society
Therefore, at the risk of oversimpliﬁcation, these two
ways of analysing data – as raw material and as product
of digital labour – can be recast as a debate about the
relationship between real capital and commodities in
the digital economy.
Building from Bourdieu, I suggest a better framing of
data is as a form of capital that is distinct from, but has
its roots in, economic capital. Data capital is more than
knowledge about the world, it is discrete bits of information that are digitally recorded, machine processable,
easily agglomerated, and highly mobile. Like social and
cultural capital, data capital is convertible, in certain
conditions, to economic capital. But, as the next section
‘Deriving value from data capital’ shows, not all value
derived from data is necessarily or primarily monetary.
Data capital is institutionalised in the information infrastructure of collecting, storing, and processing data; that
is, the smart devices, online platforms, data analytics,
network cables, and server farms.
Importantly, these characteristics of data capital mean
it can be continually captured and circulated, thus data
collection is driven by the logic of capital accumulation
as described by Marx. ‘The circulation of money as capital is an end in itself, for the valorization of value takes
place only within this constantly renewed movement. The
movement of capital is therefore limitless’ (Marx, 1990:
253). This unending accumulation of capital, represented
by M-C-M0 -C-M00 -C-M-. . . , is a deﬁning feature of capitalism. In digital capitalism, data is not a substitute for
money, but is rather elevated and put ‘on the same level
as ﬁnancial capital,’ as a report by Oracle and MIT
Technology Review Custom (2016: 2) states. The imperative, then, is to constantly collect and circulate data by
producing commodities that create more data and building infrastructure to manage data. The stream of data
must keep ﬂowing and growing.
Ultimately, continuing the cycle of data capital
becomes an intrinsic motivation, a driving force, for
ﬁrms. As Marx explains, ‘Use-values must therefore
never be treated as the immediate aim of the capitalist;
nor must the proﬁt on any single transaction. His aim is
rather the unceasing movement of proﬁt-making’
(Marx, 1990: 254). The same can be said of data. The
capitalist is not concerned with the immediate use of a
data point or with any single collection, but rather the
unceasing ﬂow of data-creating. This point is illustrated
by the fact that data is very often collected without
speciﬁc uses in mind. Indeed, the practice of collecting
data ﬁrst and ﬁguring it out later is increasingly a core
part of how businesses and government bodies operate.
‘It does not matter that the amounts [of data] collected
may vastly exceed a ﬁrm’s imaginative reach or analytic
grasp. The assumption is that it will eventually be
useful, i.e. valuable’ (Fourcade and Healy, 2017: 13).
At a public talk in early 2017, Andrew Ng, an artiﬁcial

Sadowski
intelligence researcher who has held top positions at
Google, Baidu, and Coursera, was candid about this
prevailing logic of data accumulation: ‘At large companies, sometimes we launch products not for the revenue,
but for the data. We actually do that quite often ... and
we monetize the data through a diﬀerent product’
(Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2017). The
conditions needed to convert data capital into economic capital may never arrive, but that does not
stop the cycle of accumulation.
The shift towards data capital takes advantage of the
ideological and regulatory groundwork that has been
laid since at least the 1980s to create a political economic landscape conducive to ﬁnance capitalism
(Konczal and Abernathy, 2015). Under neoliberal governance, ﬁnancial capital is treated as if it exists in
transnational space beyond borders and governance
(Major, 2012). The same attitudes are directly applied
to data capital. This view was crystallised by Carl Bildt
(2015), the former Prime Minister of Sweden and chair
of the Global Commission on Internet Governance, in
an op-ed for the Financial Times: ‘Barriers against the
free ﬂow of data are, in eﬀect, barriers against trade.’
Bildt was rebuking proponents of ‘digital sovereignty’
rules in Europe, which would require non-EU companies to keep data about EU citizens in servers that are
geographically based in Europe. Any restraints on the
ﬂow of data are said to hinder economic growth and
technological innovation (Morozov, 2015). Trade deals
like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership and the Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership (aim to)
enshrine the free ﬂow of data across countries and continents (Selby, 2017). Like ﬁnance, data is now governed as an engine of growth. If ﬁnancial ﬁrms are
free to shuttle capital from country to country, then
similarly technology corporations must also be free to
store and sell data wherever they want. This means, for
example, that a company could collect the personal
information of Americans, store the data in Taiwan,
and sell it in Europe (Rossiter, 2017).
The focus on data and dataﬁcation should not be
seen as usurping ﬁnancialisation, but rather as adding
new sources of value and new tools of accumulation.
There is a long history of crossover between innovations in information technology and innovations in
ﬁnance (MacKenzie, 2018). Far from being in competition with each other, Wall Street and Silicon Valley
are converging around data capital as the new frontier
of accumulation and circulation.

Deriving value from data capital
The question of what kinds of data are collected and
how they are used is very important. So far, this paper
has treated data in a generalised way for the sake of

5
analysing it as a form of capital. Of course, not all data
is the same, nor is it used in the same way. The same
can be said of capital in general. Similarly, value is
derived from data in a number of diﬀerent ways.
Diﬀerent industries necessarily accumulate diﬀerent
kinds of data to ﬁt their own motivations and goals.
The focus is typically put on ‘user data,’ such as from
exercise apps that collect data about people’s physical
activity, vital signs, and geolocation. But, as the examples below show, value can also be squeezed from many
other kinds of data about things like machinery, transportation, and moon phases. A full analysis of diﬀerent
types of data and in-depth theorising of how value is
derived from data are both outside the scope of this
paper. However, in this section, I provide an outline
of ﬁve major ways data is used to create value. The
list is not meant to be comprehensive. Future work is
needed about the increasing number of ways and reasons that data capital is accumulated and valorised,
especially by companies, governments, and organisations that are not typically treated as part of the ‘technology sector.’
. Data is used to proﬁle and target people. Many business models and services in data capitalism are based
on the value proposition that knowing more about
people will, in some way, translate to more proﬁt
and/or power. Some examples include: Internetbased companies often make their revenue by
serving personalised advertisements. Data brokers
collate data to create dossiers on individuals and
categorise them into market segments. Credit bureaus crunch data so they can assign scores meant
to denote a person’s ﬁnancial risk and trustworthiness. Retailers can charge diﬀerent prices based on
the customer’s characteristics. Political consultants
analyse data to decide who is susceptible to certain
kinds of messaging and inﬂuence.
. Data is used to optimise systems. Processes can
become more eﬃcient by analysing data that reveals
how to eliminate waste, improve productivity, and
do more with less. This might mean an industrial
manufacturer installing sensors on machines to
monitor and adjust their operation. Or, city government using algorithmic analysis to assess how public
services should be run. This way of deriving value is
also the basis for Taylorism, starting with time–
motion studies of factory workers in the early
1900s. Now, digital Taylorism is represented by
wristbands patented by Amazon that are strapped
to warehouse workers to track where their hands
are at all times and provide ‘haptic feedback’ when
they work ineﬃciently (Novak, 2018).
. Data is used to manage and control things. This is a
power/knowledge relationship in which data is a

6
digital, mobile, processable form of knowledge. The
idea is that by amassing data about a thing, then the
ability to exercise power over that thing – and, in
turn, extract more data from it – is enhanced. This
might be as mundane as a person keeping track of
their diet and exercise so they can manage their
health. Or, as worrying as police using body-worn
cameras and drones equipped with facial recognition
and license plate reader software. Or, as complex as
an engineer overseeing the traﬃc patterns of a city so
they can manage how millions of people move
through space. Such data can be used to inform
human decision-making or fed into automated systems that respond in real-time.
. Data is used to model probabilities. With enough
data covering a wide range of variables over a
period of the time – fed to the right algorithms and
analysts – many companies promise they can predict
the future. While these ‘predictions’ are actually
probabilities, there is a growing market for datadriven forecasting tools. For example, police departments use ‘predictive’ systems to create ‘heat lists’
and ‘hot spots’ that name who and where has a
high likelihood of criminal activity. HunchLab, a
predictive policing tool, uses data about ‘dozens of
other factors like population density; census data;
the locations of bars, churches, schools, and transportation hubs; schedules for home games – even
moon phases’ (Chammah and Hansen, 2016: n.p.).
Similarly, urban control rooms process a constant
stream of data to create simulations of events like
disaster response and snapshots of what the city
might look like at certain times and days in the
future.
. Data is used to build stuﬀ. Digital systems and services are often built on data. They require data to
operate, they use existing stores of data, and they
collect new streams of data. As services become platforms and devices become ‘smart’ they also become
data-driven and Internet-connected to facilitate the
ﬂow of data. For example, Uber would not work
without real-time data about drivers and passengers.
Many upgrades to consumer goods (e.g. smart
homes) and transformations to urban environments
(e.g. smart cities) are premised on extracting and
exploiting data. Advances in emerging technologies
like artiﬁcial intelligence and autonomous vehicles
also require mountains of diverse data.
. Data is used to grow the value of assets. Things like
buildings, infrastructure, vehicles, and machinery are
depreciating assets. They lose value over time as the
forces of entropy – or, wear and tear – take their toll.
However, upgrading assets with smart technologies
that collect data about their use helps combat the
normal cycle of deterioration. As ﬁnancier Stuart

Big Data & Society
Kirk (2018) states, ‘Artiﬁcial intelligence combined
with the internet of things will result in physical
things becoming more adaptive and responsive –
thereby extending their useful lives.’ Rather than
depreciating, smartiﬁed assets can maintain and
gain value. Or, if they do not grow value, at least
data can slow its decay.

Data extraction
When we talk about data as being ‘collected,’ ‘gathered,’ or even ‘mined’, the image conjured is one of
neutral accumulation, as if data existed out in the
world as a distinct thing readily available to be harvested. However, analysing this process in terms of
extraction emphasises the people targeted by, and the
exploitative nature of, dataveillance.
Much of the valuable data capital extracted from the
world is about people – their identities, beliefs, behaviours, and other personal information. As Karen
Gregory (2014: n.p.) puts it: ‘Big Data, like Soylent
Green, is made of people.’ This means that accumulating data often goes hand-in-hand with increasingly
invasive systems for probing, monitoring, and tracking
people (Schneier, 2016). Surveillance – or, ‘dataveillance’ – capabilities are integrated into everything ranging from consumer goods to civic infrastructure. For
businesses, much of the value produced by ‘smart’ technologies does not necessarily come from you buying the
good, but rather from you using it. (Or, even just
having it around since many smart technologies are
always in sense and record mode.) Interacting with
smart technologies – especially ones integrated into
your everyday, personal life – generates reams of data
that would otherwise be out of reach to the companies
that want it. And, it seems, to the governments that
want that data: In February 2016, the then US director
of national intelligence, James Clapper, admitted to a
Senate panel that government agencies may treat networked smart technologies as a portal into people’s
homes and lives: ‘In the future, intelligence services
might use the [Internet of Things] for identiﬁcation,
surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or
user credentials’ (Ackerman and Thielman, 2016: n.p.).
A typical example of a smart update to an everyday
technology is the refrigerator. The regular refrigerator
is a passive object: it just keeps food cold. The smart
refrigerator is an active object: it keeps food cold, but it
also keeps track of things like your favourite brands,
what foods you eat at what times, and when your food
is almost out or expired. The smart refrigerator can
then take that data and use it, for example, to send
targeted advertisements, recommend sponsored recipes,

Sadowski
monitor your dietary intake, and purchase replacement
food from the grocery store. The smart refrigerator can
also be used for other purposes that are far from fridgelike, such as a surveillance device remotely accessed by
police who wish to peek into the owner’s house (Butler,
2017). This is how the logic of accumulation works: it
transforms the refrigerator into a data producing, collecting and transmitting machine. The same logic is
behind the growing stable of smart technologies that
are increasingly embedded with sensors, processors
and network connections. ‘The genuine Internet of
Things wants to invade that refrigerator, measure it,
instrument it, monitor any interactions with it; it
would cheerfully give away a fridge at cost,’ argues
Bruce Sterling (2014: loc. 68).
The pushback against business models based on data
capital are already starting to play out: In 2017, an
American appliance maker, Whirlpool, ﬁled trade complaints that asked the US government to impose tariﬀs
on its Korean competitors, LG and Samsung, because
the Korean companies are selling smart appliances at
cheap prices, which is eating into the market share of
companies like Whirlpool. LG and Samsung are able to
do this because they recognize, as The New Yorker
observed, ‘the way to win in a data-driven business is
to push prices as low as possible in order to build your
customer base, enhance data ﬂow, and cash in in the
long-term’ (Davidson, 2017: n.p.). While Whirlpool is
looking to cash in on the purchase of an appliance, LG
and Samsung are banking on the data that comes from
people using the appliance.
Thus, rather than existing only as a commodity to be
sold, a smart device becomes (perhaps primarily) a
means of producing data. This logic inﬂuences the
design of systems ranging from robotic vacuum cleaners secretly mapping users’ homes so the manufacturer
can exploit that data (Deahl, 2017) to the methods of
urban planning deployed to manage cities (Barns,
2017). Data accumulation drives many key decisions
about technological development, political governance,
and business models. As Shoshana Zuboﬀ explains,
within the context of what she calls ‘surveillance
capitalism,’
‘The logic of accumulation organizes perception and
shapes the expression of technological aﬀordances at
their roots. It is the taken-for-granted context of any
business model. Its assumptions are largely tacit, and
its power to shape the ﬁeld of possibilities is therefore
largely invisible. It deﬁnes objectives, successes, failures, and problems. It determines what is measured,
and what is passed over; how resources and people
are allocated and organized; who is valued in what
roles; what activities are undertaken – and to what purpose. The logic of accumulation produces its own social

7
relations and with that its conceptions and uses of
authority and power.’ (Zuboﬀ, 2015: 77)

When data is treated as a form of capital, the
imperative to collect as much data, from as many
sources, by any means possible intensiﬁes existing practices of accumulation and leads to the creation of new
ones. Indeed, following in the footsteps of other
extractive enterprises through capitalism’s history
such as land grabs and resource mining (Mezzadra
and Neilson, 2017), many of the now common practices
of data accumulation should actually be understood in
terms of the more forceful practice of data extraction,
wherein data is taken without meaningful consent and
fair compensation for the producers and sources of that
data. The terminology used to describe the ways data is
accumulated – especially data about people – elides the
fact that this data is often acquired in hidden ways for
purposes unknown to the targets of dataveillance
(Andrejevic, 2014).
The question of consent is relatively straightforward.
The problematic way technology ﬁrms treat consent is
no secret; it is an issue raised often by journalists and
academics. When companies seek consent to record,
use, and/or sell a person’s data, it is typically done in
the form of a contract. The most common kind is called
an end-user licensing agreements (EULA). They are a
hallmark of digital technology and account for most of
the contracts we enter into – almost on a daily basis if
you use the Internet or software (Thatcher et al., 2016).
These are the pages on websites and applications that
make you click ‘agree’ or ‘accept’ before you can use
the service. EULAs are known as ‘standard-form’ or
‘boilerplate’ contracts because they are generically
applied to all users (Zamir, 2014). They are one-sided,
non-negotiated, and non-negotiable; you either agree
or you are denied access. ‘It is hard, therefore, to consider them to be free and voluntary arrangements since
one party has no power to enact their demands’ (Birch,
2016: 124). Companies are routinely caught smuggling
dubious clauses into their EULAs; like, for example,
requiring users to give up rights to ownership of their
data or to restrict what kind of data is collected and
how it is used (Hutton and Henderson, 2017).
Moreover, EULAs are designed to prevent even the
most enterprising person from being informed of the
binding terms and conditions. They are long, dense
legal documents. One study concluded it would take
76 days, working for 8 hours a day, to read the privacy
policies a person typically encounters in a year
(Madrigal, 2012).
EULAs are the ideal-type of pro forma ‘consent,’
which may be better-termed acquiescence (Pasquale,
2015). That is, EULAs are less a method of consent
in any meaningful and more a form of compliance.

8
As Jaron Lanier (2013: 314) argues, ‘The reason people
click ’yes’ is not that they understand what they’re
doing, but that that it is the only viable option other
than boycotting a company in general, which is getting
harder to do.’ Thus, even in many cases where people
must actively agree to their data being accumulated,
this agreement bears little resemblance to common
meanings of consent – let alone robust forms of
informed consent. When a thing is taken without consent we call it ‘theft.’ Just because the thing taken here
is information about a person, rather than some material object, the ethical relevance should not be nulliﬁed.
It is extraction nonetheless.
The question of fair compensation is more complicated, in large part because it can be diﬃcult to put a
fair price on personal information. Diﬀerent types of
data are valued diﬀerently by diﬀerent businesses. The
value of data also rises non-linearly in relation to the
amount of data. The larger and more diverse a data
bank, the more information and uses can be derived
from it. So one individual’s data may not be readily
converted to economic capital, but the aggregated
data of hundreds, thousands, millions of individuals
can be immensely valuable. Even though it is diﬃcult
to price data, we can judge the fairness of compensation
in at least two ways: (1) what kind of compensation, if
any, is oﬀered for data and (2) what is the diﬀerence
between the compensation for data producers and the
value obtained by data capitalists?
First, compensation most often comes in the form of
access to services like Facebook’s platform and
Google’s search engine. Rather than charging money
to use the service, the owner collects data as payment.
Even if we concede that some people think this is perfectly fair compensation, these service providers are
outnumbered by the countless companies that collect,
use, and sell personal data often without the knowledge
of – let alone compensation for – those whose data they
possess (Bouk, forthcoming; Crain, 2016). Many companies fail the ﬁrst test right away: receiving nothing
can hardly be seen as fair.
Second, the value of data capital is massive. Some of
the wealthiest companies in the world, like Facebook
and Google, are built on data capital. The data broker
industry is estimated to generate $200bn in annual revenue (Crain, 2016). The three biggest data brokers
alone – Experian, Equifax and Transunion – each
bring in billions of dollars annually. Even for relatively
small data brokers, the diﬀerence between the value of
data and the compensation provided for it is striking
(Roderick, 2014). Additionally, other major sectors like
ﬁnance, insurance and manufacturing are increasingly
relying on data capital to generate value. For many of
these companies the data they use is primarily about
people and created by those people doing things. These

Big Data & Society
companies are accumulating billions of dollars in surplus value from the ‘digital labour’ done by people
(Scholz, 2012), while paying little to nothing in
return. Thatcher et al. (2016: 994) argue that these
extractive practices go so far as to ‘mirror processes
of primitive accumulation or accumulation by dispossession that occur as capitalism colonizes previously
noncommodiﬁed, private times and places.’ When a
person does not receive a fair oﬀer for the work they
have done or thing they have sold, we call it ‘exploitation’ – and this level of exploitation and inequity is
indicative of extraction.
Before concluding, it is important to note that not all
data extraction is equal. There are crucial issues related
to the ways identity and class aﬀect how, what, and
why data is extracted. At times, data is disproportionally extracted from certain groups, such as when poor
people of colour are subjected to systematic tracking by
government agencies and ﬁnancial institutions
(Eubanks, 2018). At other times, certain groups are
missing from data sets, such as when facial recognition
systems inaccurately identify people of colour because
they have been trained with data composed of mostly
white male faces – people who look like their programmers (Lohr, 2018). While it is beyond the scope of this
article, there is a need for further analysis of the
unevenness of data extraction. Such work should
build from critical studies of information technology;
some relevant, recent books include: Digital Sociologies
(Daniels et al. 2016), The Intersectional Internet (Noble
and Tynes, 2016), Programmed Inequality (Hicks,
2017), Algorithms of Oppression (Noble, 2018), and
Automating Inequality (Eubanks, 2018). My hope is
that this article also lends theoretical support to this
future work.

Conclusion
This article has centred data as a core component of
political economy in the 21st century. It has analysed
the way in which data is collected and circulated like
capital and is treated by governments and ﬁrms like
capital. By applying the theories of Marx and
Bourdieu, data is analysed as a form of capital that is
distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital.
Data collection is thus driven by the perpetual cycle
of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital
to construct and rely upon a world in which everything
is made of data. The supposed universality of data
reframes everything as falling under the domain of
data capitalism. All spaces must be subjected to dataﬁcation. If the universe is conceived of as a potentially
inﬁnite reserve of data, then that means the accumulation and circulation of data can be sustained forever.
The imperative to capture all data, from all sources,

Sadowski
by any means possible inﬂuences many key decisions
about business models, political governance, and
technological development. Following this imperative
leads to accumulation by extraction in which personal
data is taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By analysing surveillance technology and the
data economy in terms of extraction, critical work
can move beyond focusing (almost exclusively) on privacy and security. As important as these issues are, they
elide the systemic issues of inequity and exploitation
that are endemic to the contemporary political economy of data (Coll, 2014).
Moreover, conceiving of many common practices of
data collection as extraction helps lay the normative
groundwork for political and legal responses to rampant, invasive data accumulation. Such responses could
include regulations – essentially capital controls – on
what types of data companies can collect, how they can
collect it, where they can send and store it, and how
much data a company can possess, both in aggregate
and about individuals. It could also include new models
of data ownership and governance like, for example,
‘managing crucial parts of the data economy as public
infrastructure’ (The Economist, 2017a: n.p.). The fact
that a featured article in The Economist would recommend that governments take over parts of the data
economy and break up monopolistic ﬁrms like
Google should be seen as a bellwether for how powerful
Big Data (as in Big Oil and Big Finance) has become.
This illustrates the need for further critical thought
about the political economy of data, as well as reforms
and alternatives to data capitalism.
The analysis in this paper is not meant to mark a
new epoch in political economy wherein – as executives
and engineers in Silicon Valley are fond of saying –
everything has changed and nothing will ever be the
same. Instead, data capitalism is more of a shift in
focus; it is a transition toward conceptualising a new
kind of capital and new methods of accumulation. This
transition follows from one of the dominant socio-economic regimes of the past few decades: ﬁnance capitalism (Davis and Walsh, 2017; Krippner, 2005; Konczal
and Abernathy, 2015). As this article has shown, there
are similarities between ﬁnancialisation and dataﬁcation. Both have signiﬁcant ‘implications for the production of space, corporate governance, accumulation
regimes, and everyday life’ (Fields, 2017: 1). Both
seek to maximise value extraction by using innovative
methods of capital creation and circulation, whether
through complex ﬁnancial instruments or complex
information technologies. Both use technically opaque
systems that shield them from oversight (Pasquale,
2015), use their political inﬂuence to skirt regulation
(Roderick, 2014), and use their powerful capabilities
to engage in exploitative and predatory practices

9
(Taylor and Sadowski, 2015). In addition to these similarities, there is direct overlap between the two regimes,
such as credit agencies using large sets of personal and
demographic data to create hyper-individualised policies and scores (Hurley and Adebayo, 2017) and Wall
Street traders using ‘high frequency trading’ algorithms
to circulate capital at hyper-speed (Arnoldi, 2016).
The institutions leading the way in data capitalism
are explicit about the connections between ﬁnancial
capital and data capital. They are not calling for one
to replace the other, rather they are arguing that ﬁnance
and data should be seen as diﬀerent but equal forms of
capital, which supercharge each other. Dataﬁcation,
like ﬁnancialisation before it, is a new frontier of accumulation and next step in capitalism. Compared to
ﬁnancialisation, dataﬁcation is still in its early days,
but the level of wealth and power wielded by data capitalists is already massive and still growing. The theories
and methods used to analyse ﬁnance capitalism and
information technology must now be synthesised and
applied to studying the meaning, practices and implications of dataﬁcation as a political economic regime.
