The Matrix andTransmedia Storytelling

In Peter Bagge's irreverent "Get It?," one of some twenty-five comic
stories commissioned for Tlie Matrix homepage, three buddies are exiting a theater where they have just seen the Wachowski brothers' opus
for the first time (fig. 3.1). For two of them, The Matrix (1999) has been a
transforming experience:
" W o w ! That was Awesome!"
"The Matrix was the best movie I've seen in ages!"

The third is perplexed. From the looks on the faces of the prune-faced
older couple walking in front of them, his confusion is not unique. "I
didn't understand a word of it!"
" Y o u mean you were sitting there scratching your head through the

whole thing?"

W h e n they retire to a local bar, one b u d d y persists i n trying to explain
The Matrix, patiently clarifying its concepts of manufactured reality,
machine-controlled worlds, a n d "jacking i n , " while the other, being
more pessimistic, grumbles, "I don't think y o u ' l l ever understand i t . "
A s their hapless p a l walks away, the other two turn out to be cybernetic
"agents," w h o concede that it's a good thing most humans don't get
this movie, since "the fewer humanoids w h o comprehend what's really
going on, the fewer we w i l l have to destroy."
Noted for his sharp social satire i n Hate comics (1990-1998) and, more
recently, Reason magazine, Bagge contrasts between those w h o "get"
The Matrix and those w h o do not. Something about the film leaves some
filmgoers feeling inadequate and others empowered. Bagge wrote this
strip immediately after the release of the first Matrix movie. A s we w i l l
see, things get only more complicated from there.
N o film franchise has ever made such demands o n its consumers.
The original movie, The Matrix, took us into a w o r l d where the line between reality and illusion constantly blurred, and where the bodies of
humans are stored as an energy source to fuel machines while their
minds inhabit a w o r l d of digital hallucinations. N e o , the hacker protag¬
onist-turned-messiah, gets pulled into the Z i o n resistance movement,
w o r k i n g to overturn the "agents" w h o are shaping reality to serve their
o w n ambiguous ends. The prerelease advertising for the first film tantalized consumers w i t h the question, "What is the M a t r i x ? " sending
them to the Web i n search of answers. Its sequel, The Matrix Reloaded
(2003), opens without a recap and assumes w e have almost complete
mastery over its complex mythology and ever-expanding cast of secondary characters. It ends abruptly w i t h a promise that all w i l l make
sense w h e n w e see the third installment, The Matrix Revolutions (2003).
To truly appreciate what w e are watching, w e have to do our homework.
The filmmakers plant clues that w o n ' t make sense until w e play the
computer game. They d r a w o n the back story revealed through a series of animated shorts, w h i c h need to be downloaded off the Web or
watched off a separate D V D . Fans raced, dazed and confused, from the
theaters to p l u g into Internet discussion lists, where every detail w o u l d
be dissected and every possible interpretation debated.
W h e n previous generations wondered whether they "got" a movie,
it was usually a European art movie, an independent film, or perhaps
an obscure late-night cult flick. But The Matrix Reloaded broke all box
1

office records for R-rated films, earning a mind-boggling $134 m i l l i o n
in revenues i n its first four days of release. The video game sold more
than a million copies i n its first week on the market. Before the movie
was even released, 80 percent of the A m e r i c a n film-going public identified The Matrix Reloaded as a "must see" title.
The Matrix is entertainment for the age of media convergence, integrating multiple texts to create a narrative so large that it cannot be
contained w i t h i n a single m e d i u m . The Wachowski brothers played the
transmedia game very well, putting out the original film first to stimulate interest, offering up a few Web comics to sustain the hard-core
fan's hunger for more information, launching the anime i n anticipation
of the second film, releasing the computer game alongside it to surf the
publicity, bringing the whole cycle to a conclusion w i t h The Matrix Revolutions, and then turning the whole mythology over to the players of
the massively multiplayer online game. Each step along the w a y built
on what has come before, while offering new points of entry.
The Matrix is also entertainment for the era of collective intelligence.
Pierre L e v y speculates about what k i n d of aesthetic works w o u l d respond to the demands of his knowledge cultures. First, he suggests that
the "distinction between authors and readers, producers and spectators, creators and interpreters w i l l b l e n d " to form a "circuit" (not quite
a matrix) of expression, w i t h each participant w o r k i n g to "sustain the
activity" of the others. The artwork w i l l be what L e v y calls a "cultural
attractor," drawing together and creating common ground between d i verse communities; we might also describe it as a cultural activator, setting into motion their decipherment, speculation, and elaboration. The
challenge, he says, is to create works w i t h enough depth that they can
justify such large-scale efforts: " O u r primary goal should be to prevent
closure from occurring too quickly." The Matrix clearly functions both
as a cultural attractor and a cultural activator. The most committed consumers track d o w n data spread across multiple media, scanning each
and every text for insights into the w o r l d . K e a n u Reeves explained to
TV Guide readers: "What audiences make of Revolutions w i l l depend on
the amount of energy they put into it. The script is full of cul-de-sacs
and secret passageways." Viewers get even more out of the experience
if they compare notes and share resources than if they try to go it alone.

In this chapter, I am going to describe The Matrix phenomenon as
transmedia storytelling. A transmedia story unfolds across multiple
media platforms, w i t h each new text m a k i n g a distinctive and valuable

Searching f o r the O r i g a m i U n i c o r n

contribution to the whole. In the ideal form of transmedia storytelling, each m e d i u m does what it does best—so that a story might be
introduced i n a film, expanded through television, novels, and comics;
its w o r l d might be explored through game play or experienced as
an amusement park attraction. Each franchise entry needs to be selfcontained so y o u don't need to have seen the film to enjoy the game,
and vice versa. A n y given product is a point of entry into the franchise
as a whole. Reading across the media sustains a depth of experience
that motivates more consumption. Redundancy burns up fan interest
and causes franchises to fail. Offering new levels of insight and experience refreshes the franchise and sustains consumer loyalty. The economic logic of a horizontally integrated entertainment industry—that
is, one where a single company may have roots across all of the different media sectors—dictates the flow of content across media. Different
media attract different market niches. Films and television probably
have the most diverse audiences; comics and games the narrowest. A
good transmedia franchise works to attract multiple constituencies by
pitching the content somewhat differently in the different media. If
there is, however, enough to sustain those different constituencies—
and if each w o r k offers fresh experiences—then y o u can count on a
crossover market that w i l l expand the potential gross.
Popular artists—working i n the cracks of the media industry—have
realized that they can surf this new economic imperative to produce
more ambitious and challenging works. A t the same time, these artists
are b u i l d i n g a more collaborative relationship w i t h their consumers:
w o r k i n g together, audience members can process more story information than previously imagined. To achieve their goals, these storytellers
are developing a more collaborative model of authorship, co-creating
content w i t h artists w i t h different visions and experiences at a time
when few artists are equally at home i n all media.
Okay, so the franchise is innovative, but is The Matrix any good?
M a n y film critics trashed the later sequels because they were not sufficiently self-contained and thus bordered on incoherent. M a n y games
critics trashed the games because they were too dependent on the film
content and d i d not offer sufficiently new experiences to players. M a n y
fans expressed disappointment because their o w n theories about the
w o r l d of The Matrix were more rich and nuanced than anything they
ever saw on the screen. I w o u l d argue, however, that we do not yet
have very good aesthetic criteria for evaluating works that play them-

selves out across multiple media. There have been far too few fully
transmedia stories for media makers to act w i t h any certainty about
what w o u l d constitute the best uses of this new mode of storytelling, or
for critics and consumers to k n o w h o w to talk meaningfully about
what works or doesn't w o r k w i t h i n such franchises. So let's agree for a
moment that The Matrix was a flawed experiment, an interesting failure, but that its flaws d i d not detract from the significance of what it
tried to accomplish.
Relatively few, if any, franchises achieve the full aesthetic potential
of transmedia storytelling—yet. M e d i a makers are still finding their
way and are more than w i l l i n g to let someone else take the risks. Yet, at
the heart of the entertainment industry, there are young and emerging
leaders (such as Danny Bilson and N e i l Young at Electronic Arts or
Chris Pike at Sony Interactive) w h o are trying to push their companies
to explore this new model for entertainment franchises. Some of them
are still regrouping from their first bleeding-edge experiments i n this
space (Dawson's Desktop, 1998)—some of w h i c h had modest success
(The Blair Witch Project, 1999), some of w h i c h they n o w saw as spectacular failures (Majestic, 2001). Some of them are already having closeddoor meetings to try to figure out the best w a y to ensure more productive collaborations across media sectors. Some are w o r k i n g on hot new
ideas masked by nondisclosure agreements. A l l of them were watching
closely i n 2003, w h i c h Newsiveek had called "The Year of The Matrix," to
see how audiences were going to respond to the Wachowski brothers'
ambitious plans. A n d , like Peter Bagge, they were looking at the faces
of people as they exit the theaters, demanding to k n o w if they "got" it.

W h a t Is the Matrix?
Umberto Eco asks what, beyond being loved, transforms a film such as
Casablanca (1942) into a cult artifact. First, he argues, the w o r k must
come to us as a "completely furnished w o r l d so that its fans can quote
characters and episodes as if they were aspects of the private sectarian
w o r l d . " Second, the work must be encyclopedic, containing a rich array of information that can be drilled, practiced, and mastered by devoted consumers.
The film need not be w e l l made, but it must provide resources
consumers can use i n constructing their o w n fantasies: " I n order to

transform a w o r k into a cult object one must be able to break, dislocate,
unhinge it so that one can remember only parts of it, irrespective of
their original relationship to the w h o l e . " A n d the cult film need not
be coherent: the more different directions it pushes, the more different
communities it can sustain a n d the more different experiences it can
provide, the better. We experience the cult movie, he suggests, not as
having "one central idea but many," as "a disconnected series of i m ages, of peaks, of visual icebergs."
The cult film is made to be quoted, Eco contends, because it is made
from quotes, archetypes, allusions, and references d r a w n from a range
of previous works. Such material creates " a sort of intense emotion
accompanied b y the vague feeling of a déjà v u . " For Eco, Casablanca is
the perfect cult movie because it is so unselfconscious i n its borrowings: " N o b o d y w o u l d have been able to achieve such a cosmic result
intentionally." A n d for that reason, Eco is suspicious of cult movies
by design. In the age of postmodernism, Eco suggests, no film can be
experienced w i t h fresh eyes; all are read against other movies. In such a
w o r l d , "cult has become the normal w a y of enjoying movies."
If Casablanca exemplifies the classical cult movie, one might see The
Matrix as emblematic of the cult movie i n convergence culture. Here's
science fiction writer Bruce Sterling trying to explain its fascination:

First and foremost, the film's got pop appeal elements. All kinds of elements: suicidal attacks by elite special forces, crashing helicopters, oodles
of martial arts, a chaste yet passionate story of predestined love, bugeyed monsters of the absolute first water, fetish clothes, captivity and torture and daring rescue, plus really weird, cool submarines. . . . There's
Christian exegesis, a Redeemer myth, a death and rebirth, a hero in selfdiscovery, The Odyssey, Jean Baudrillard (lots of Baudrillard, the best part
of the film), science fiction ontological riffs of the Philip K. Dick school,
Nebuchadnezzar, the Buddha, Taoism, martial-arts mysticism, oracular
prophecy, spoon-bending telekinesis, Houdini stage-show magic, Joseph
Campbell, and Godelian mathematical metaphysics.

A n d that's just i n the first film!
The film's endless borrowings also spark audience response. Layers
upon layers of references catalyze and sustain our epistemophilia; these
gaps and excesses provide openings for the many different knowledge
communities that spring u p around these cult movies to display their

expertise, d i g deep into their libraries, and bring their minds to bear on
a text that promises a bottomless pit of secrets. Some of the a l l u s i o n s —
say, the recurring references to "through the looking glass," the White
Rabbit, and the Red Queen, or the use of mythological names for the
characters (Morpheus, Persephone, Trinity)—pop off the screen u p o n
first viewing. Others—say, the fact that at one point, N e o pulls a copy
of Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation (1981/1995) from his shelf—
become clear only after y o u talk about the film w i t h friends. S o m e —
like the fact that Cypher, the traitor, is referred to at one point as " M r .
Reagan" and asks for an alternative life where he is an actor w h o gains
political power—are clear only w h e n y o u put together information from
multiple sources. Still others—such as the license plates on the cars
(such as DA203 or IS5416), w h i c h reference specific and context-appropriate Bible verses (Daniel 2:3 or Isaiah 54:16)—may require y o u to move
through the film frame by frame on your D V D player.
The deeper y o u drill d o w n , the more secrets emerge, all of w h i c h
can seem at any moment to be the key to the film. For example, Neo's
apartment number is 101, w h i c h is the room number of the torture
chamber i n George Orwell's 1984 (1949). Once you've picked u p this
number, then y o u discover that 101 is also the floor number for the
Merovingians' nightclub and the number of the h i g h w a y where the
characters clash i n The Matrix Reloaded, and from there, one can't help
but believe that all of the other various numbers i n the film may also
carry hidden meanings or connect significant characters and locations
together. The billboards i n the backgrounds of shots contain cheat
codes that can be used to unlock levels i n the Enter the Matrix (2003)
game.
The sheer abundance of allusions makes it nearly impossible for any
given consumer to master the franchise totally. In this context, the
Wachowski brothers have positioned themselves as oracles—hidden
from v i e w most of the time, surfacing only to offer cryptic comments,
refusing direct answers, and speaking w i t h a single voice. Here, for example, are some characteristic passages from one of their few online
chat sessions:
Question: "There are quite a few h i d d e n messages i n the movie
that I notice the more I watch it. C a n y o u tell me about h o w
many there are?"
Wachowski brothers: "There are more than y o u ' l l ever k n o w . "

Question: " H a v e y o u ever been told that The Matrix has Gnostic
overtones?"
Wachowski brothers: " D o y o u consider that to be a good thing?"
Question: " D o y o u appreciate people dissecting your movie? D o
y o u find it a bit of an honor or does it annoy you a little, especially w h e n the person may have it all wrong?
Wachowski brothers: "There's not necessarily ever an 'all wrong.'
Because it's about what a person gets out of the movie, what an
i n d i v i d u a l gets out of the m o v i e . "
The Wachowskis were more than happy to take credit for whatever
meanings the fans located, all the while i m p l y i n g there was more,
m u c h more, to be found if the community put its collective m i n d to
work. They answered questions w i t h questions, clues w i t h clues. Each
clue was mobilized, as quickly as it materializes, to support a range of
different interpretations.
So what is The Matrix? A s one fan demonstrates, the question can be
answered i n so many different ways:
• Is it a "love story"? (Keanu Reeves said that i n an interview.)
• Is it a "titanic struggle between intuition and controlling intellect"?
(Hugo Weaving = A g e n t Smith said that i n an interview about The

Matrix Reloaded.)
• Is it a story about religious salvation? (The Matrix Reloaded was banned
i n Egypt, because it is "too religious.")
• Is it a story about "Believing i n something" or about " N o t believing i n
something"?
• Is it a story about "artificial h u m a n i t y " or "artificial spirituality"?
• Is it a story w i t h elements from Christianity? Buddhism? Greek m y thology? Gnosticism? H i n d u i s m ? Freemasonry? The secret society P r i ory of Z i o n (Prieure d u Notre Dame d u Sion) (and its connection to
the use of chessboard imagery at the castle Rennes-le-Chateau)?
• Is N e o a reincarnated Buddha? O r a new Jesus Christ (Neo Anderson
= new son of man)?
• Is it a science-fiction movie? A fantasy movie?
• Is it a story about secret societies keeping society under control?
• Is it a story about men's history or men's future?
• Is it just a visually enhanced futuristic K u n g - F u movie? A modern
Japanime?

Even w i t h all of the film releases out on D V D , and thus subject to being
scrutinized indefinitely, the most dedicated fans were still trying to figure out The Matrix and the more casual viewers, not accustomed to putting this k i n d of w o r k into an action film, had concluded that the parts
just didn't add up.

"Synergistic Storytelling"
The Matrix is a bit like Casablanca to the nth degree, w i t h one important
difference: Casablanca is a single movie; The Matrix is three movies and
more. There is, for example, The Animatrix (2003), a ninety-minute program of short animated films, set i n the w o r l d of The Matrix and created by some of the leading animators from Japan, South Korea, and
the United States, including Peter C h u n g (Aeon Flux, 1995), Yoshiaki
Kawajiri (Wicked City, 1987), Koji M o r i m o t o (Robot Carnival, 1987), and
Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, 1998). The Matrix is also a series of
comics from cult writers and artists, such as B i l l Sienkiewicz (Elektra:
Assassin, 1986-87), N e i l G a i m a n (The Sandman, 1989-96), Dave Gibbons
(Watchmen, 1986-87), Paul C h a d w i c k (Concrete, 1987-98), Peter Bagge
(Hate, 1990-98), D a v i d L a p h a m (Stray Bullets, 1995-), and Geof Darrow
(Hard Boiled, 1990-92). The Matrix is also two games—Enter the Matrix,
produced by D a v i d Perry's Shiny Entertainment, and a massively mul¬
tiplayer game set i n the w o r l d of The Matrix, scripted i n part by Paul
Chadwick.
The Wachowskis wanted to w i n d the story of The Matrix across all of
these media and have it all add up to one compelling whole. Producer
Joel Silver describes a trip the filmmakers took to Japan to talk about
creating an animated television series:
"I remember on the plane ride back, The Blair Witch P h e n o m e n o n
Larry sat d o w n w i t h a yellow p a d and The concept of transmedia storytelling

Burkittsville witch and the disappearance of the production crew that forms
the central plot of the movie by going
online and finding this curious Web site
that seemed to be absolutely real in
every detail.The site provided documentation of numerous witch sightings
over the past centuries, most of which
are not directly referenced in the film
but form the backdrop for its action. A
pseudodocumentary investigating the
witch aired on the Sci Fi Channel, with
little to set it apart from the many
other documentaries about supernatural phenomena the network periodically
airs. After the film's release, Oni Press
released several comic books that it
claimed were based on the accounts
of another person who had met the
witch while walking in the woods near
Burkittsville. Even the soundtrack was
presented as a tape found in the abandoned car.
All of these elements made the world
of the film more convincing, enhancing
the immediacy the Haxans, as the film's
creative team called themselves, had
achieved through their distinctive handheld-video style and improvisational
acting. Dan Myrick, one of the film's
producers, spelled out what the group
called their "prime directive": " W e
tried to create a fake legend, complete
with multiple points of view, skeptics,
and unexplainable mysteries. Nothing
about the legend could be provable, and
everything had to seem like it could
have a logical explanation (which the
reader would be led away from as
quickly as possible.)"

Ed Sanchez, another member of the
team, explained: "Everything was based

the game and w h i c h for the m o v i e . The
consumer w h o has played the game or
watched the shorts w i l l get a different
experience of the movies than one w h o
has simply had the theatrical film experience. The whole is worth more than the
sum of the parts.
We may better understand how this
new mode of transmedia storytelling operates by looking more closely at some
of the interconnections between the various Matrix texts. For example, i n the
animated short, Final Flight of the Osiris
(2003), the protagonist, Jue, gives her life
trying to get a message into the hands
of the Nebuchadnezzar crew. The letter
contains information about the machines
boring their w a y d o w n to Zion. In the
final moments of the anime, Jue drops the
letter into a mailbox. A t the opening of
Enter the Matrix, the player's first mission
is to retrieve the letter from the post office
and get it into the hands of our heroes.
A n d the opening scenes of The Matrix
Reloaded show the characters discussing
the "last transmissions of the Osiris."
For people w h o see only the movie, the
sources of the information remain u n clear, but someone w h o has a transmedia
experience w i l l have played an active
role i n delivering the letter and may have
traced its trajectory across three different
media.
16

Similarly, the character of The K i d is
introduced i n another of the animated
shorts, The Kid's Story (2003), about a h i g h
school student w h o discovers on his o w n
the truth about the Matrix as N e o and his
friends try to rescue h i m from the agents.

In The Matrix Reloaded, they reencounter
The K i d on the outskirts of Z i o n , where
he begs to join their crew: "It's fate. I
mean you're the reason I'm here, N e o , "
but N e o defers, saying, "I told y o u , k i d ,
you found me, I didn't find y o u . . . . Y o u
saved yourself." The exchange is staged
as if everybody i n the audience w o u l d
know what the two are talking about
and feels more like a scene involving an
already established character than their
first on-screen introduction. The K i d ' s efforts to defend Z i o n became one of the
core emotional hooks i n the climactic battle i n Revolutions.
In The Matrix: Reloaded, Niobe appears
unexpectedly i n the freeway chase just i n
time to rescue Morpheus and Trinity, but
for people w h o play the game, getting
Niobe to the rendezvous point is a key
mission. A g a i n , near the end of The Matrix Reloaded, Niobe and her crew are dispatched to blow u p the power plant, but
apart from the sense that the p l a n must
have w o r k e d to enable what we see on
screen to unfold, the actual details of her
operation is not represented, so that it can
be played out i n more depth i n the game.
We reencounter Niobe at the start of The
Matrix Revolutions where she was left off
at the climax of Enter the Matrix.

on this one decision to make everything
as real as possible
Let's continue
with the prime directive—the idea that
this is a website put up by people interested in the case, trying to bring justice
or closure or promote an investigation
into the mystery.We set up the timeline, added details to the backstory....
We started fabricating artifacts, paintings, carvings, old books, and I would
scan them in." Sanchez added a discussion board and saw the emergence of a
community of fans who were fascinated
with the Blair Witch mythology: " W h a t
we learned from Blair Witch is that if
you give people enough stuff to explore,
they will explore. Not everyone but
some of them will.The people who do
explore and take advantage of the
whole world will forever be your fans,
will give you an energy you can't buy
2

through advertising
It's this web of
information that is laid out in a way that
keeps people interested and keeps
people working for it. If people have to
work for something they devote more
time to it. And they give it more emotional value." Sanchez freely acknowledges that they had approached the site
and the spin-offs as marketing, but they
became an integral part of the experience: "It was the kind of marketing
which I would have gotten into as a
consumer... .We ended up exploiting
the web in ways that as far as movies
were concerned, nobody had ever done
before."

By the standards of classical H o l l y w o o d storytelling, these gaps (such as

confuse the spectator. The o l d H o l l y w o o d system depended on redundancy to ensure that viewers could follow the plot at all times, even

during a crucial scene. The new H o l l y w o o d demands that we keep our
eyes o n the road at all times, and that w e do research before we arrive
at the theater.
This is probably where The Matrix fell out of favor w i t h the film critics, w h o were used to reviewing the film and not the surrounding apparatus. Few of them consumed the games or comics or animated shorts,
and, as a consequence, few absorbed the essential information they contained. A s Fiona M o r r o w from the London Independent explained, " Y o u
can call me old-fashioned—what matters to me is the film and only the
film. I don't want to have to 'enhance' the cinematic experience by overloading o n souped-up flimflam." Those w h o realized there was relevant information i n those other sources were suspicious of the economic motives behind what Salon's Ivan A s k w i t h called "synergistic
storytelling": " E v e n if the new movies, game, and animated shorts live
up to the h i g h standards set b y the first film, there's still an uneasy feeling that Warner Bros, is taking advantage of The Matrix's cult following to cash i n while it can." The San Jose Mercury's M i k e Antonucci saw it
all as "smart marketing" more than "smart storytelling."
So let's be clear: there are strong economic motives behind transmedia storytelling. M e d i a convergence makes the flow of content across
multiple media platforms inevitable. In the era of digital effects and
high-resolution game graphics, the game w o r l d can n o w look almost
exactly like the film world—because they are reusing many of the same
digital assets. Everything about the structure of the modern entertainment industry was designed w i t h this single idea i n m i n d — t h e construction and enhancement of entertainment franchises. A s we saw i n
the previous chapter, there is a strong interest i n integrating entertainment and marketing, to create strong emotional attachments and use
them to make additional sales. M i k e Saksa, the senior vice president for
marketing at Warner Bros., couldn't be more explicit on this point:
"This [The Matrix] truly is Warner Bros.'s synergy. A l l divisions w i l l
benefit from the property. . . . We don't k n o w what the upside is, we
just k n o w it's going to be very h i g h . "
The enormous " u p s i d e " is not just economic, however. The Matrix
franchise was shaped b y a whole new vision of synergy. Franchising a
popular film, comic book, or television series is nothing new. Witness
the endless stream of plastic figurines available i n M c D o n a l d ' s H a p p y
Meals. Cross-promotion is everywhere. But m u c h of it, like the H a p p y
M e a l toys, are pretty lame and easily forgotten. Current licensing ar18

rangements ensure that most of these products are peripheral to what
drew us to the original story i n the first place. Under licensing, the central media company—most often the film producers—sells the rights
to manufacture products using its assets to an often unaffiliated third
party; the license limits what can be done w i t h the characters or concepts to protect the original property. Soon, licensing w i l l give w a y to
what industry insiders are calling "co-creation." In co-creation, the
companies collaborate from the beginning to create content they k n o w
plays w e l l i n each of their sectors, allowing each m e d i u m to generate
new experiences for the consumer and expand points of entry into the
franchise.
The current licensing system typically generates works that are redundant (allowing no new character background or plot development),
watered d o w n (asking the new media to slavishly duplicate experiences better achieved through the old), or riddled w i t h sloppy contradictions (failing to respect the core consistency audiences expect w i t h i n
a franchise). These failures account for w h y sequels and franchises
have a bad reputation. Franchise products are governed too m u c h by
economic logic and not enough by artistic vision. H o l l y w o o d acts as if
it only has to provide more of the same, printing a Star Trek (1966) logo
on so many widgets. In reality, audiences want the new w o r k to offer
new insights and new experiences. If media companies reward that demand, viewers w i l l feel greater mastery and investment; deny it, and
they stomp off i n disgust.
In 2003,1 attended a gathering of top créatives from H o l l y w o o d and
the games industry, hosted by Electronic Arts; they were discussing
how co-creation might work. Danny Bilson, the vice president of intellectual property development at Electronic Arts, organized the summit
on what he calls "multiplatform entertainment." A s someone w h o has
worked i n film (The Rocketeer, 1991), television (The Sentinel, 1996; Viper,
1994), and comics (The Flash, 1990), as w e l l as i n games, Bilson understands the challenges of creating content i n each m e d i u m and of coordinating between them. H e wants to develop games that do not just
move H o l l y w o o d brands into a new media space, but also contribute to
a larger storytelling system. For this to w o r k , he argues, the story needs
to be conceived i n transmedia terms from the start:
21

We create movies and games together, organically, from the ground u p ,
w i t h the same creative force d r i v i n g them. Ideally that creative force

involves movie writers a n d directors w h o are also gamers. In any art
form, y o u have to like it to d o w e l l w i t h it; i n fact, y o u have to be a fan of
it to do w e l l at it. Take that talent and b u i l d multiplatform entertainment.
The movie a n d game are designed together, the game deepens a n d expands the fiction but does not s i m p l y repeat material from the film. It
should be organic to what made the f i l m experience compelling.
G o i n g f o r w a r d , people are going to want to go deeper into stuff they
care about rather than sampling a lot of stuff. If there's something I love,
I want it to be bigger than just those t w o hours i n the movie theater or a
one hour a week experience o n TV. I want a deepening of the universe.
. . . I want to participate i n it. I've just been introduced to the w o r l d i n the
f i l m a n d I want to get there, explore it. Y o u need that connection to the
w o r l d to make participation exciting.

Bilson wants to use his position as the m a n w h o supervises all creative
properties for the w o r l d ' s leading game publisher to create multiplatform entertainment. H i s first step is the development of GoldenEye:
Rogue Agent (2004), a James Bond game where one gets to play the part
of classic Bond villains like Dr. N o or Goldfinger, restaging confronting
007 w i t h i n digital re-creations of the original movie sets. Everything i n
the game is consistent w i t h what viewers k n o w from the Bond movies,
but the events are seen from an alternative moral perspective.
This level of integration and coordination is difficult to achieve even
though the economic logic of the large media conglomerates encourages them to think i n terms of synergies and franchises. So far, the most
successful transmedia franchises have emerged w h e n a single creator
or creative unit maintains control. H o l l y w o o d might well study the
ways that Lucasfilm has managed and cultivated its Indiana Jones (1981)
and Star Wars (1977) franchises. W h e n Indiana Jones went to television,
for example, it exploited the medium's potential for extended storytelling and character development: The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles
(1992) showed the character take shape against the backdrop of various
historical events and exotic environments. W h e n Star Wars moved into
print, its novels expanded the timeline to show events not contained
i n the f i l m trilogies, or recast the stories around secondary characters,
as d i d the Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina (1995) series, w h i c h fleshes
out those curious-looking aliens i n the background of the original
m o v i e . W h e n Star Wars went to games, those games didn't just enact
film events; they showed what life w o u l d be like for a Jedi trainee or a

bounty hunter. Increasingly, elements are dropped into the films to create openings that w i l l only be fully exploited through other media.
While the technological infrastructure is ready, the economic prospects sweet, a n d the audience p r i m e d , the media industries haven't
done a very good job of collaborating to produce compelling transme¬
dia experiences. Even w i t h i n the media conglomerates, units compete
aggressively rather than collaborate. M a n y believe that m u c h greater
coordination across the media sectors is needed to produce transmedia
content. Electronic Arts (EA) explored this model i n developing its Lord
of the Rings titles. E A designers w o r k e d on location w i t h Peter Jackson's
production unit i n N e w Zealand. A s N e i l Young, the m a n i n charge of
the Lord of the Rings franchise for E A , explained,
I wanted to adapt Peter's w o r k for our m e d i u m i n the same w a y that he
has adapted Tolkien's w o r k for his. Rather than being some derivative
piece of merchandise along the same continuum w i t h the poster, the pen,
the m u g , or the key chain, maybe w e could turn that p y r a m i d u p the side
of its head, leverage those pieces w h i c h have come before, a n d become
the pinnacle of the property instead of the basement. Whether y o u are
making the m u g , whether y o u are m a k i n g the key chain, or whether y o u
are making the game, pretty m u c h everyone has access to the same
assets. For me, w h e n I took over Lord of the Rings, that seemed untenable
if y o u want to b u i l d something that captured Peter's unique vision, a n d
H o w a r d Shore's music, and the actors, and the look of this w o r l d , and . . .
y o u needed m u c h more direct access. Instead of w o r k i n g exclusively
through the consumer products group, w e built a partnership directly
w i t h the N e w Line Production company, 3 Foot 6 Productions that functioned as a clearing house for the things w e needed.

23

This system allowed them to import thousands of "assets" from the
film production into the game, ensuring an unprecedented degree of
fidelity to the details of Tolkien's w o r l d . A t the same time, w o r k i n g
closely w i t h Jackson and the other filmmakers gave Young greater latitude to explore other dimensions of that w o r l d that w o u l d not appear
on screen.

other languages aimed both at their
domestic markets and at global export.
American television and film increasingly is remaking successful products
from other markets, ranging from
Survivor (2000) and Big Brother (2000),
which are remakes of successful Dutch
series, to The Ring (2002), a remake of a
Japanese cult horror movie, or Vanilla
Sky (2001 ), a remake of a Spanish science fiction film. Many of the cartoons
shown on American television are made
in Asia (increasingly in Korea), often
with only limited supervision by Western companies. Many Western children
today are more familiar with the characters of the Japanese Pokémon series
than they are with those from the European fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm
or Hans Christian Anderson. W i t h the

foreign media producers will distribute

promoted by fan communities and
immigrant populations. We will return
to the role of grassroots convergence in
the globalization process in chapter 4.
For the moment, let's focus on corporate convergence.Three distinctive
kinds of economic interests are at play
in promoting these new cultural
exchanges: national or regional producers who see the global circulation of
their products not simply as expanding
their revenue stream but also as a
source of national pride; multinational
conglomerates who no longer define
their production or distribution decisions in national terms but seek to
identify potentially valuable content
and push it into as many markets as
possible; and niche distributors who
search for distinctive content as a
means of attracting upscale consumers
and differentiating themselves from
stuff already on the market.
Kapur's image of a Chinese SpiderMan may not be too far fetched, after
all. As comics and graphic novels have
moved into chain bookstores, such as
Barnes & Noble and Borders, the shelf
space devoted to manga far outstrips
the space devoted to Americanproduced content, reflecting a growing
gap in sales figures as well. Seeking to
reclaim the market they were losing to
Asian competition, Marvel Comics
experimented in 2002 with a new
Mangaverse title, which reimagined and
resituated their stable of superheroes
within Japanese genre traditions:
Spider-Man is a ninja, the members of
the Avengers assemble into a massive
robot, and the Hulk turns into a giant
green monster. Initially conceived as a
one-shot novelty, the Mangaverse

K y m Barrett. The cast was emphatically
multiracial, making use of African A m e r ican, Hispanic, South Asian, southern
European, and aboriginal performers to
create a Z i o n that is predominantly nonwhite.
Perhaps most importantly, the Wachowski brothers sought out Japanese
and other A s i a n animators as collaborators on The Animatrix. They cite strong
influences from manga (Japanese comics)
and anime, w i t h Morpheus's red leather
chair a homage to Akira (1988) and Trinity's jumpsuit coming straight from Ghost
in the Shell (1995). Arguably, their entire
interest i n transmedia storytelling can be
traced back to this fascination with what
anthropologist M i m i Ito has described as
Japan's "media m i x " culture. O n the one
hand, the media mix strategy disperses
content across broadcast media, portable
technologies such as game boys or cell
phones, collectibles, and location-based
entertainment centers from amusement
parks to game arcades. O n the other,
these franchises depend on hypersociability, that is, they encourage various
forms of participation and social interactions between consumers. This media
mix strategy has made its w a y to A m e r i can shores through series like Pokémon
(1998) and Yu-Gi-Oh! (1998), but operates
i n even more sophisticated forms i n more
obscure Japanese franchises. In bringing i n Japanese animators closely associated w i t h this media mix strategy, the
Wachowski brothers found collaborators
w h o understood what they were trying to
accomplish.

The Wachovvski brothers didn't simp l y license or subcontract and hope for
the best. The brothers personally wrote
and directed content for the game, drafted scenarios for some of the animated
shorts, and co-wrote a few of the comics. For fans, their personal engagement
made these other Matrix texts a central
part of the "canon." There was nothing
fringe about these other media. The filmmakers risked alienating filmgoers b y
making these elements so central to the
unfolding narrative. A t the same time,
few filmmakers have been so overtly fascinated with the process of collaborative
authorship. The Matrix Web site provides
detailed interviews w i t h every major
technical worker, educating fans about
their specific contributions. The D V D s ,

range of creative and technical work.
We can see collaborative authorship at

Even if the books bomb in India, however, they have generated a great deal of
interest among Western comic fans.

terms of corporate hybridity. Hybridity
occurs when one cultural space—in
this case, a national media industry—
absorbs and transforms elements from
another; a hybrid work thus exists
betwixt and between two cultural
traditions while providing a path that
can be explored from both directions.
Hybridity has often been discussed as a
strategy of the dispossessed as they
struggle to resist or reshape the flow of
Western media into their culture—
taking materials imposed from the
outside but making them their own.
Here, hybridity can be seen as a corporate strategy, one that comes from a
position of strength rather than vulnerability or marginality, one that seeks to
control rather than contain transcultural consumption.

current social and economic order. In
Think Like a Mountain (1996), Concrete
joins forces w i t h the Earth First! movement that is spiking trees and waging
war on the lumber industry to protect
an old-growth forest. Chadwick's political commitments are expressed not only
through the stories but also through his
visual style: he creates full-page spreads
that integrate his protagonists into their
environments, showing the small creatures that exist all around us, hidden
from v i e w but impacted by the choices
we make.
Chadwick uses his contributions to
The Matrix to extend the film's critique of
the urban landscape and to foreground
the ecological devastation that resulted
from the war between the machines and
the humans. In "The M i l l e r ' s Tale," his
protagonist, a member of the Z i o n underground, tries to reclaim the land so that
he can harvest wheat and make bread.

The A r t of World-Making
The Wachowski brothers built a playground where other artists could experiment and fans could explore. For this to
work, the brothers had to envision the
w o r l d of The Matrix w i t h sufficient consistency that each installment is recognizably part of the whole and w i t h enough
flexibility that it can be rendered i n all of
these different styles of representation—
from the photorealistic computer animation of Final Flight of the Osiris to the
blocky graphics of the first Matrix Web
game. Across those various manifestations of the franchise, there are dozens of
recurring motifs, such as the falling green

included performers drawn from across
the Chinese diaspora—Zhang Ziyi
(Mainland China), Chan Chen (Taiwan),
Chow Yun-Fat (Hong Kong), and
Michelle Yeoh (Malaysia). Ang Lee
describes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
as a "combination platter," stressing its
borrowings from multiple cultural traditions. James Schamus agrees: " W e
ended up making an eastern movie for
western audiences and in some ways a
more western movie for eastern audiences." These examples of corporate
hybridity depend on consumers with
the kinds of cultural competencies that
could only originate in the context of
global convergence, requiring not simply knowledge of Asian popular culture
but an understanding of its similarities
and differences with parallel traditions
in the West.
While The Animatrix can be read,
alongside Spider-Man:

India, as an

example of "transcreation," The Matrix
feature films simply added various
multinational and multicultural references largely invisible to Western
consumers but designed to give people
in many different parts of the world
toeholds within the franchise. Some
elements may move into the foreground or the background depending
on the local competencies of media
consumers. One of my graduate
students, for example, shared with me
this example:"Many friends in India told
me about how discussions of the South
Asian family in Revolutions ended up
becoming discussions about labor
migration to the U.S., the position of
nonwhites in the high-tech software
industry, outsourcing, etc." In Japan,

More and more, storytelling has become the art of world building, as artists

and more toys based on the secondary

our time to enflame the viewership and
start giving a few more clues as to what
was about to happen

We had to give

all of the clues without giving away the
actual events. Our job was to whet the
appetites.

Part of what makes a site like
Dawson's Desktop possible has been a
shift in the ways narratives operate in
American television. In the 1960s, most
episodes of most prime-time shows
were totally self-contained, introducing
a temporary crisis in the life of their
protagonists, but having to end more or
less as they began. Anyone who grew up
during that era knew that Gilligan and
the other castaways were never going
to get off the island no matter how vivid
the promise of rescue seemed at the
first commercial break. By the 1970s
and 1980s, television producers such as
Stephen Bochco (Hi/I Street Blues, 1981)

were pushing for the chance to expand
the narrative complexity of episodic television and facing some resistance from
network executives who were not certain people would remember what had

visions could only be fully appreciated by
reading through the coffee-table books
that accompany the release of such films
and provide commentary on costume design and art direction decisions.
N e w - m e d i a theorist Janet M u r r a y has
written of the "encyclopedic capacity" of
digital media, w h i c h she thinks w i l l lead
to new narrative forms as audiences seek
information beyond the limits of the indiv i d u a l story. She compares this process
of world-making i n games or cinema to
Faulkner, whose novels and short stories
added together to flesh out the life and
times of a fictional county i n Mississippi.
To make these worlds seem even more
real, she argues, storytellers and readers
begin to create "contextualizing devices
—color-coded paths, time lines, family
trees, maps, clocks, calendars, and so
o n . " Such devices "enable the viewer to
grasp the dense psychological and cultural spaces [represented by modern stories] without becoming disoriented."
The animated films, the game, and the
comics function i n a similar w a y for The
Matrix, adding information and fleshing
out parts of the w o r l d so that the whole
becomes more convincing and more comprehensible.
Mahiro Maeda's "The Second Renaissance" (2003), for example, is a richly detailed, rapid-paced chronicle that takes us
from the present moment to the era of
machine rule that opens the first Matrix
movie. The animated short is framed as a
documentary produced by a machine i n telligence to explain the events leading to
their triumph over the humans. "The Sec34

for The Matrix universe, giving a context
for events such as the trial of B116ER,
the first machine to k i l l a h u m a n , the M i l lion Machine M a r c h , and the "darkening
of the skies" that are mentioned i n other
Matrix texts. A s M a e d a explains,
In Part One, we see humans treat robots as objects, while i n Part Two the
relationship between h u m a n being and
robot switches, as humans are studied

h o w the two sides c h a n g e d . . . . I wanted
to show the broadness of the society,
and h o w the robots were such a part
of the background of life that they were
treated as mere objects by h u m a n beings. . . .

happened in previous episodes. By the
1990s, many of these battles had been
fought and won, helped perhaps by the
presence of the V C R that allowed people to review favorite series and the
Internet that could provide summaries
for people who did miss key plot points.
The push on series such as Babylon 5
(1994) or The X-Files (1993) was toward
season-long story arcs (and plot information that unfolded gradually across
multiple seasons).Today, even many sitcoms depend heavily on audience familiarity with program history.And shows
such as 24 (2001) assume an audience
will be able to remember events that
occurred weeks before on television but
only a few hours earlier in the story.
As a television series, Dawson's Creek
was not a radical departure from network norms, but what it did on the Web
was more innovative.The device of the
desktop allowed the producers to take
viewers deeper inside the heads of the
characters, to see other dimensions of
their social interactions. Because they
coordinated with the series writers, the
Web team could provide back story for
upcoming events.As Pike explained,"If
Aunt Jenny is sending e-mail out of the
blue, there's a reason, and you had better keep an eye on it, because in three
or four or five episodes, when Aunt
Jenny arrives, you are going to feel good
because you already know this character was from the 60s and drinks too
much.You know the complete back
story so that when the character walks
on screen, you know who they are and
your relationship to the series has been
enriched. We've done our job."
From the start, the Dawson's Desktop team collaborated with the program's active fans. Its producers said
they were inspired to expand the story
from reading all of the fan fiction that
sprang up around the characters.They

inhabitants for assistance i n overthrowing the agents. Without learning about
the many times the machines had pursued diplomatic relations w i t h the h u mans a n d been rejected, it is hard to
understand w h y his approach yielded
such transforming results. Similarly, the
images showing the humans' efforts to
block off the Earth from solar rays resurfaces w h e n we see Neo's craft go above
the cloud level and into the blue skies that
humans have not seen for generations.
"Second Renaissance" introduces many
of the weapons deployed during the final
assault o n Z i o n , including the massive
"mecha" suits the humans wear as they
fight off the invaders.
A t the same time, "The Second Renaissance" builds upon "Bits and Pieces of
Darren Crosdale. Dawson's Creek:The Official
Information," one of The Matrix comics
Companion (London: Ebury, 1999), pp. 145-147.
d r a w n by Geof Darrow from a script by
the Wachowski brothers. The comic introduced the pivotal figure of
B116ER, the robot w h o kills his masters w h e n he is about to be junked
and whose trial first asserted the concept of machine rights within
h u m a n culture. M u c h like "The Second Renaissance," "Bits and Pieces
of Information" draws o n the existing iconography of human-rights
struggles, quoting directly from the Dred Scott decision and naming the
robot after Bigger Thomas, the protagonist of Richard Wright's Native
Son (1940). If the first feature film started w i t h a simple opposition
between man and machines, the Wachowski brothers used these intertexts to create a m u c h more emotionally nuanced and morally complicated story. In the end, m a n and machines can still find common interests despite centuries of conflict and oppression.
Most film critics are taught to think i n terms of very traditional story
structures. M o r e and more, they are talking about a collapse of storytelling. We should be suspicious of such claims, since it is hard to imagine that the public has actually lost interest i n stories. Stories are basic
to all h u m a n cultures, the primary means by which we structure, share,
and make sense of our common experiences. Rather, we are seeing the

closely monitored the five hundred or
so Dawson's Creek fan sites and created
an advisory board of twenty-five creators who they felt had developed the
best amateur contest. As Andrew
Schneider, a leader of the project,
explained, "We're in touch with them all
the time. We wanted to make sure the
fans were getting what they wanted.
They helped us design the interface and
they told us what they liked and did not
like." As the site continued, the fans
were encouraged to send their own
e-mails to Dawson as if they were fellow
Capeside High students, and he would
respond to their fictional personas on
the site. In that way, the producers
integrated the creative energy of the
fan community into developing new
content, which, in turn, would sustain
fan interest.

emergence of new story structures, w h i c h create complexity by expanding the range of narrative possibility rather than p u r s u i n g a single
path w i t h a beginning, middle, and end. Entertainment Weekly proclaimed 1999, the year that The Matrix, Fight Club, The Blair Witch Project, Being John Malkovich, Run Lola Run, Go, American Beauty, and The
Sixth Sense hit the market, as "the year that changed the movies." F i l m goers educated on nonlinear media like video games were expecting a
different k i n d of entertainment experience. If y o u look at such works
by o l d criteria, these movies may seem more fragmented, but the fragments exist so that consumers can make the connections on their o w n
time and i n their o w n ways. M u r r a y notes, for example, that such
works are apt to attract three very different kinds of consumers: "the
actively engaged real-time viewers w h o must find suspense and satisfaction i n each single episode and the more reflective long-term audience w h o look for coherent patterns i n the story as a whole . . . [and]
the navigational viewer w h o takes pleasure i n following the connections between different parts of the story and i n discovering multiple
arrangements of the same material."
For all of its innovative and experimental qualities, transmedia storytelling is not entirely new. Take, for example, the story of Jesus as
told i n the M i d d l e Ages. Unless y o u were literate, Jesus was not rooted
i n a book but was something y o u encountered at multiple levels i n
your culture. Each representation (a stained-glass w i n d o w , a tapestry,
a psalm, a sermon, a live performance) assumed that y o u already
knew the character and his story from someplace else. M o r e recently,
writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien sought to create new fictions that selfconsciously imitated the organization of folklore or mythology, creating
an interlocking set of stories that together flesh out the w o r l d of M i d d l e
Earth. Following a similar logic, M a e d a explicitly compares "The Second Renaissance" to Homeric epics: "I wanted to make this film as
beautiful as a story from ancient Greek myth, and explore what it
means to be human, as well as not human, and h o w the ideas are related to one another. In Greek myths there are moments where the best
side of h u m a n nature is explored, and others where the protagonists
are shown as very cruel. I wanted to bring the same atmosphere to
these episodes."
39

When the Greeks heard stories about Odysseus, they didn't need to
be told w h o he was, where he came from, or what his mission was.
Homer was able to create an oral epic by b u i l d i n g on "bits and pieces

of information" from preexisting myths, counting on a knowledgeable
audience to ride over any potential points of confusion. This is w h y
high school students today struggle w i t h The Odyssey, because they
don't have the same frame of reference as the original audience. Where
a native listener might hear a description of a character's helmet and
recognize h i m as the hero of a particular city-state and, from there,
know something of his character and importance, the contemporary
high school student runs into a brick w a l l , w i t h some of the information that once made these characters seem so real buried in some arcane tome. Their parents may confront a similar barrier to fully engaging w i t h the film franchises so valued by their children—walking
into an X-Men movie w i t h no background i n comics might leave you
confused about some of the minor characters w h o have much deeper
significance to long-term comics readers. Often, characters i n transme¬
dia stories do not need to be introduced so much as reintroduced, because they are k n o w n from other sources. Just as Homer's audience
identified w i t h different characters depending on their city-state, today's children enter the movie with preexisting identifications because
they have played w i t h the action figures or game avatars.
The idea that contemporary H o l l y w o o d draws on ancient myth
structures has become common w i s d o m among the current generation of filmmakers. Joseph Campbell, the author of The Hero with a
Thousand Faces (1949), praised Star Wars for embodying what he has
described as the " m o n o m y t h , " a conceptual structure abstracted from a
cross-cultural analysis of the w o r l d ' s great religions. Today, many
screenwriting guides speak about the "hero's journey," popularizing
ideas from Campbell, and game designers have similarly been advised
to sequence the tasks their protagonists must perform into a similar
physical and spiritual ordeal. Audience familiarity with this basic plot
structure allows script writers to skip over transitional or expository
sequences, throwing us directly into the heart of the action.
42

43

Similarly, if protagonists and antagonists are broad archetypes rather
than individualistic, novelistic, and rounded characters, they are immediately recognizable. We can see The Matrix as borrowing these archetypes both from popular entertainment genres (the hacker protagonist,
the underground resistance movement, the mysterious men i n black)
as w e l l as from mythological sources (Morpheus, Persephone, The Oracle). This reliance on stock characters is especially important i n the case
of games where players frequently skip through the instruction books

Skenovano pro studijni ucely

Searching f o r t h e O r i g a m i U n i c o r n

and past early cut scenes, allowing little time for exposition before
grabbing the controller and trying to navigate the w o r l d . F i l m critics
often compared the characters i n The Matrix films to video game characters. Roger Ebert, for example, suggests that he measured his concern for N e o i n Revolutions less i n terms of affection for the character
and "more like the score i n a video game." Slate's D a v i d Edelstein
suggests that a spectacular opening stunt b y Trinity i n The Matrix
Reloaded "has the disposable feel of a video game. You can imagine the
program resetting itself, and then a l l of those little zeros and ones
reassembling to play a g a i n . " In both cases, the writers use the video
game analogy to i m p l y a disinterest i n the characters, yet, for gamers,
the experience is one of immediacy: the character becomes a vehicle for
their direct experience of the game w o r l d . By tapping video game iconography, The Matrix movies create a more intense, more immediate
engagement for viewers w h o come into the theater k n o w i n g w h o these
characters are and what they can do. A s the film continues, we flesh out
the stick figures, adding more back story and motivation, and w e continue to search for additional insights across other media as w e exit the
theater.
When I suggest parallels between The Odyssey and The Matrix, I anticipate a certain degree of skepticism. I do not claim that these modern
works have the same depth of incrusted meanings. These new " m y thologies," if we can call them that, are emerging i n the context of an
increasingly fragmented and multicultural society. W h i l e The Matrix
films have been the subject of several books linking them to core philosophical debates, and while many fans see these films as enacting religious myths, articulating spirituality is not their primary function, the
perspective they take is not likely to be read literally by their audience,
and their expressed beliefs are not necessarily central to our everyday
lives. Homer wrote within a culture of relative consensus and stability,
whereas The Matrix emerges from a time of rapid change and cultural
diversity. Its goals are not so much to preserve cultural traditions as to
put together the pieces of the culture i n innovative ways. The Matrix is
a work very m u c h of the moment, speaking to contemporary anxieties
about technology and bureaucracy, feeding on current notions of multiculturalism and tapping recent models of resistance. The story may reference a range of different belief systems, such as the Judeo-Christian
Messiah myth, to speak about these present-day concerns w i t h some
visionary force. A t the same time, b y evoking these earlier narratives,
44

122

Searching for the O r i g a m i U n i c o r n

The Matrix invites us to read more deeply i n the Western tradition and
bring what we find there to bear on contemporary m e d i a .
Consider, for example, this reading of the tribal celebration i n The
Matrix Reloaded through the lens of biblical interpretation:
46

The feet [stamping] on the ground means that Z i o n is on Earth. Plain and
simple. This parallels the Architect scene, and gets to the main thesis. We
are cast out of the "perfection" of H e a v e n and l i v i n g i n the Real World.
Symbolically, the M a t r i x is Heaven. C y p h e r makes this point i n the first
movie. The Real W o r l d is hard, dirty, and uncomfortable. The Matrix
is, w e l l , paradise. This point is made again i n the first movie by Agent
Smith, w h o calls the M a t r i x "the perfect h u m a n w o r l d " [paraphrased].
Recall that the Architect scene happens i n utterly clean, utterly white perfection. The Biblical reference is clear enough. N e o , Trinity, Morpheus,
and the rest of Z i o n have rejected G o d ' s Garden of Eden where all their
needs are taken care of i n favor of a hard, scrabbling existence where at
least they have free w i l l .

47

So, even if y o u see classical myths as more valuable than their contemporary counterpart, works such as The Matrix draw consumers back to
those older works, giving them new currency.
F i l m critic Roger Ebert ridicules this attempt to insert traditional
myth into a p o p science f i c t i o n / k u n g fu epic:
These speeches provide not meaning, but the effect of meaning: it sure
sounds like those guys are saying some profound things. This w i l l not
prevent fanboys from analyzing the philosophy of The Matrix Reloaded i n
endless web postings. Part of the f u n is becoming an expert i n the deep
meaning of shallow p o p mythology; there is something refreshingly
ironic about becoming an authority on the transient extrusions of mass
culture, and M o r p h e u s (Laurence Fishburne) n o w joins Obi-Wan Kenobi
as the Plato of our age.

48

This criticism looks different if y o u accept that value arises here from
the process of looking for meaning (and the elaboration of the story by
the audience) and not purely from the intentionality of the Wachowski
brothers. What the Wachowski brothers d i d was trigger a search for
meaning; they d i d not determine where the audience w o u l d go to find
their answers.

Additive Comprehension
If creators do not ultimately control what we take from their transme¬
dia stories, this does not prevent them from trying to shape our interpretations. N e i l Young talks about "additive comprehension." H e cites
the example of the director's cut of Blade Runner, where adding a small
segment showing Deckard discovering an origami unicorn invited v i e w ers to question whether Deckard might be a replicant: "That changes
your whole perception of the film, your perception of the ending. . . .
The challenge for us, especially w i t h The Lord of the Rings, is h o w do
we deliver the origami unicorn, h o w do we deliver that one piece of
information that makes y o u look at the films differently." Young explained h o w that moment inspired his team: " I n the case of The Lord of

comprehension is the fact that Gandalf is T h e C l o u d m a k e r s and

Searching for the O r i g a m i U n i c o r n

Here's how one of the game's Puppetmasters, Sean Stewart, described
the initial concept:
Create an entire self-contained world on
the web, say a thousand pages deep, and
then tell a story through it, advancing the
plot with weekly updates, concealing
each new piece of narrative in such a
way that it would take clever teamwork
to dig it out. Create a vast array of assets
—custom photos, movies, audio recordings, scripts, corporate blurbage, logos,
graphic treatments, web sites, flash
movies—and deploy them through a net
of (untraceable) web sites, phone calls,
fax systems, leaks, press releases, phony
2

newspaper ads, and so on ad infinitum.

The threshold (or what designers call
"the rabbit hole") into this vast universe of interconnecting Web sites was
the mystery surrounding the death of
Evan Chan and the question of what
Jeanine Salla,the "sentient machine
therapist," knew about it. But Chan's
death was simply the device that set the
plot into motion. Before the game was
over, the players would have explored
the entire universe where Spielberg's
film was set, and the authors would
have drawn upon pretty much everything they had ever thought about.
From the start, the puzzles were too
complex, the knowledge too esoteric,
the universe too vast to be solved by
any single player. As one player told
C N N , "To date, puzzles have had us
reading Godel, Escher and Bach, translat-

ing from German and Japanese, even an
obscure language called Kannada,
decrypting Morse code and Enigma, and
performing an unbelievable range of
operations on sound and image files."

races far ahead: "I want to understand
the kinds of story comprehension which
are unique to transmedia storytelling.
I've got m y w o r l d , I've got m y arcs, some
of those arcs can be expressed i n the
video game space, some of them can be
expressed i n the film space, the television
space, the literary space, and you are getting to the true transmedia storytelling."
With Enter the Matrix, the "origami

Niobe and Ghost. A s the game's designer,
D a v i d Perry, explains, every element of
the game went toward helping us understand w h o these people are: "If you play
as Ghost, who's a Z e n Buddhist Apache
assassin, y o u ' l l automatically ride shotgun i n the driving levels, which allow
y o u to fire out the w i n d o w at agents

drivers i n the Matrix universe, so when
you play the game as her, y o u ' l l get to
drive through a complex Matrix world
filled w i t h real traffic and pedestrians,
while a computer-controlled Ghost takes
out the enemies." C u t scenes (those moments i n the game which are prerecorded
and not subject to player intervention)
give us more insight into the romantic
triangle among Niobe, Morpheus, and
Locke, w h i c h helps to explain, i n part,

figure i n the movie, having only a handful of spoken lines, but his screen appearances reward those w h o have made
the effort to play the game. Some film
critics complained about the degree to
which Niobe's character displaces M o r pheus from the center of The Matrix Revolutions, as if a minor character were upstaging a well-established protagonist.
Yet, h o w we felt about Niobe w o u l d depend o n whether we had played Enter
the Matrix. Someone w h o had played the
games w o u l d have spent, perhaps, a h u n dred hours controlling Niobe's character,
compared to less than four hours watching Morpheus; struggling to keep the
character alive and to complete the missions w o u l d have resulted i n an intense
bond that w o u l d not be experienced b y

Perhaps the most spectacular example
of "additive comprehension" occurred
after the film trilogy had been completed.
With little fanfare or warning, o n M a y

To confront the "beast" required
players to work together, seeking out
friends, tapping Web communities,
drawing in anyone you could find.
Before long, smaller teams joined
forces, until there was an army of
scavengers and puzzle-solvers, putting
in hours and hours a day trying to
find their way to the bottom of the
conspiracies.
Both the Puppetmasters and the
Cloudmakers have conceded that this
was a game everyone was making up as
they went along.The team at Microsoft
had no idea that the Beast would spark
this level of fan commitment and interest, and the fans had no idea how far the
producers would be willing to go in
order to keep them engaged with the
mystery.Tom, one of the Cloudmakers,
explained, " A s we got better and better
at solving their puzzles, they had to
come up with harder puzzles.They
were responding to stuff we were saying
or doing. When we cracked a puzzle too
fast, they would change the type of
puzzles.There was one point that we
found things in their source code that
they didn't intend to be there. And they
had to write some story to cover this.
They were writing just a little ahead of
players." Writing the game proved to
be every bit as challenging. Stewart
explained, " A t our best—like the
players—we were scary good and scary

masters to develop the follow-up game
ilovebees, calls the genre alternate
reality gaming (ARG). She defines ARGs
as "an interactive drama played out
online and in real world spaces, taking
place over several weeks or months, in
which dozens, hundreds, thousands of
players come together online, form
collaborative social networks, and work
together to solve a mystery or problem
that would be absolutely impossible to
solve alone."' True to the logic of affective economics, 4orty2wo Entertainment, the company that Stewart and
others created to advance Alternate
Reality Games, explains that such activities generate product and brand awareness: " O u r aim is to carve the client's
world into today's cultural landscape, so
that, like Middle Earth or Hogwarts, it
becomes a priority destination for the
American imagination... .We create
communities passionately committed
to spending not just their money but
their imaginations in the worlds we
represent." That's what they must have
told the funders.

For the most hard-core players,
these games can be so much more.
ARGs teach participants how to
navigate complex information environments and how to pool their knowledge
and work together in teams to solve
problems. McGonigal argues that
ARGs are generating "players who feel
more capable, more confident, more
expressive, more engaged and more
connected in their everyday lives."
A well-designed A R G reshapes the way
participants think about their real and
8

other players or from some other secondary source. Morpheus's death was then
used to motivate a variety of player missions w i t h i n the game w o r l d .
E A ' s Y o u n g worried that the Wachowski brothers m a y have narrowed their
audience by m a k i n g too many demands
on them:
The more layers y o u put on something,
the smaller the market. Y o u are requiring people to intentionally invest more
time i n what it is y o u are trying to tell
them and that's one of the challenges
of transmedia storytelling. . . . If w e
are going to take a w o r l d and express
it through multiple media at the same
time, y o u might need to express it sequentially. Y o u may need to lead people
into a deep love of the story. Maybe it
starts w i t h a game and then a film and
then television. Y o u are b u i l d i n g a relationship w i t h the w o r l d rather than tryi n g to put it all out there at once.
Y o u n g m a y w e l l be right. The Wachowski brothers were so uncompromising i n
their expectations that consumers w o u l d
follow the franchise that m u c h of the
emotional payoff of Revolutions is accessible only to people w h o have played the
game. The film's attempts to close d o w n
its plot holes disappointed many hardcore fans. Their interest i n The Matrix

community's escalating expectations and
expanding interpretations and still have
remained accessible to a mass audience?
There has to be a breaking point beyond
w h i c h franchises cannot be stretched,
subplots can't be added, secondary characters can't be identified, and references
can't be fully realized. We just don't
k n o w where it is yet.
F i l m critic Richard Corliss raised these
concerns w h e n he asked his readers,
"Is Joe Popcorn supposed to carry a Matrix concordance i n his head?" The answer is no, but "Joe P o p c o r n " can p o o l his
knowledge w i t h other fans and b u i l d a
collective concordance on the Internet.
Across a range of fan sites and discussion lists, the fans were gathering information, tracing allusions, charting chains
of commands, constructing timelines, assembling reference guides, transcribing
dialogue, extending the story through
their o w n fan fiction, and speculating like
crazy about what it all meant. The depth
and breadth of The Matrix universe made
it impossible for any one consumer to
"get i t " but the emergence of knowledge
cultures made it possible for the community as a whole to d i g deeper into this bottomless text.
Such works also pose new expectations on critics—and this may be part
of what Corliss was reacting against. In
writing this chapter, I have had to tap into
the collective intelligence of the fan community. M a n y of the insights I've offered
here emerged from m y reading of fan
critics and the conversations on discussion lists. While I possess some expertise

virtual environments. As McGonigal
explains, "the best pervasive games do
make you more suspicious, more inquisitive, of your everyday surroundings.
A good immersive game will show you
game patterns in non-game places;
those patterns reveal opportunities for
interaction and intervention."' A welldesigned A R G also changes the ways
participants think about themselves,
giving them a taste of what it is like to
work together in massive teams, pooling their expertise toward a common
cause.They develop an ethic based on
sharing rather than hording knowledge;
they learn how to decide what knowledge to trust and what to discard.
Here's how one of the Cloudmakers, the
largest and most influential team on the
A l game, described their self-perception: "The 7500+ people in this group . . .
we are all one. We have manifested this
idea of an unbelievably intricate intelligence. We are one mind, one voice
We have become a part of something
greater than ourselves."
For Barry Joseph, one of the Cloudmakers, the game didn't just immerse
him in the A.I. world. Solving the game
together changed what the film meant,
offering up an alternative vision of the
ways that people would be living and
interacting in an era of new information
technologies. Against the pessimism
many found at the heart of the story,
"the image of humans living in fear of
technology's ubiquitous eye," they had
their own experience of "cooperative
behavior that takes advantage of the
powers of a group mind." The game's

l y makes me one more member of this
knowledge community—someone w h o
knows some things but has to rely on others to access additional information. I may have analytic tools for examining a range of different
media but m u c h of what I suggest here about the links between the
game and the films, for example, emerged not from m y o w n game playing but from the conversations about the game online. In the process of
writing this chapter, then, I became a participant rather than an expert,
and there is m u c h about this franchise w h i c h I still do not know. In the
future, m y ideas may feed back into the conversation, but I also w i l l
need to tap the public discussion i n search of fresh information and
insights. Criticism may have once been a meeting of two minds—the
critic and the author—but n o w there are multiple authors and multiple
critics.
Inhabiting such a w o r l d turns out to be child's play—literally. Transmedia storytelling is perhaps at its most elaborate, so far, i n children's
media franchises like Pokémon or Yu-Gi-Oh! A s education professors
D a v i d Buckingham and Julian Sefton-Green explain, "Pokémon is something y o u do, not just something y o u read or watch or consume."
There are several hundred different Pokémon, each w i t h multiple evolutionary forms and a complex set of rivalries and attachments. There is
no one text where one can go to get the information about these various
species; rather, the child assembles what they know about the Pokémon
from various media w i t h the result that each child knows something
his or her friends do not and thus has a chance to share this expertise
w i t h others. Buckingham a n d Sefton-Green explain: "Children m a y
watch the television cartoon, for example, as a w a y of gathering k n o w l edge that they can later utilize i n playing the computer game or i n
trading cards, and vice versa. . . . The texts of Pokémon are not designed
merely to be consumed i n the passive sense of the w o r d . . . . In order to
be part of the Pokémon culture, and to learn what y o u need to know,
y o u must actively seek out new information and new products and,
crucially, engage w i t h others i n doing s o . "

as part of the process by w h i c h y o u n g children learn to inhabit the new
kinds of social and cultural structures L e v y describes. Children are
being prepared to contribute to a more sophisticated knowledge culture. So far, our schools are still focused on generating autonomous
learners; to seek information from others is still classified as cheating.
Yet, i n our adult lives, we are depending more and more on others
to provide information we cannot process ourselves. O u r workplaces
have become more collaborative; our political process has become more
decentered; we are living more and more w i t h i n knowledge cultures
based on collective intelligence. O u r schools are not teaching what it
means to live and w o r k i n such knowledge communities, but popular
culture may be doing so. In The Internet Galaxy (2001), cybertheorist
M a n u e l Castells claims that while the public has shown limited interest
i n hypertexts, they have developed a hypertextual relationship to existing media content: " O u r m i n d s — n o t our machines—process culture.
. . . If our minds have the material capability to access the whole realm
of cultural expressions—select them, recombine t h e m — w e do have a
hypertext: the hypertext is inside u s . " Younger consumers have become informational hunters and gatherers, taking pleasure i n tracking
d o w n character backgrounds and plot points and m a k i n g connections
between different texts w i t h i n the same franchise. A n d so it is predictable that they are going to be expecting these same kinds of experiences from works that appeal to teens and y o u n g adults, resulting i n
something like The Matrix.
Soon, we may be seeing these same hypertextual or transmedia p r i n ciples applied to the quality dramas that appeal to more mature consumers—shows such as The West Wing (1999) or The Sopranos (1999),
for example, w o u l d seem to lend themselves readily to such expectations, and soap operas have long depended on elaborate character relationships and serialized plotlines that could easily expand beyond television and into other media. One can certainly imagine mysteries that
ask readers to search for clues across a range of different media or historical fictions that depend on the additive comprehension enabled by
multiple texts to make the past come alive for their readers. This transmedia impulse is at the heart of what I am calling convergence culture.
More experimental artists, such as Peter Greenaway or Matthew Barney, are already experimenting w i t h h o w they might incorporate transmedia principles into their work. One can also imagine that kids w h o
grew up i n this media-mix culture w o u l d produce new kinds of media

as transmedia storytelling becomes more intuitive. The Matrix may be
the next step i n that process of cultural evolution—a bridge to a newk i n d of culture and a new k i n d of society. In a hunting culture, kids
play w i t h bows and arrows. In an information society, they play w i t h
information.
N o w some readers may be shaking their heads i n total skepticism.
Such approaches w o r k best w i t h younger consumers, they argue, because they have more time on their hands. They demand way too m u c h
effort for "Joe Popcorn," for the harried m o m or the w o r k i n g stiff w h o
has just snuggled onto the couch after a hard day at the office. A s
we have seen, media conglomeration creates an economic incentive to
move i n this direction, but H o l l y w o o d can only go so far d o w n that
direction if audiences are not ready to shift their mode of consumption.
Right now, many older consumers are left confused or uninvolved with
such entertainments, though some are also learning to adapt. N o t every
story w i l l go i n this direction—though more and more stories are traveling across media and offering a depth of experience that w o u l d have
been unanticipated i n previous decades. The key point is that going i n
deep has to remain an option—something readers choose to d o — a n d
not the only w a y to derive pleasure from media franchises. A growing
number of consumers may be choosing their popular culture because
of the opportunities it offers them to explore complex worlds and compare notes w i t h others. More and more consumers are enjoying participating i n online knowledge cultures and discovering what it is
like to expand one's comprehension by tapping the combined expertise
of these grassroots communities. Yet, sometimes, we simply want to
watch. A n d as long as that remains the case, many franchises may remain big and d u m b and noisy. But don't be too surprised if around the
edges there are clues that something else is also going on or that the
media companies w i l l offer us the chance to buy into new kinds of
experiences w i t h those characters and those worlds.
