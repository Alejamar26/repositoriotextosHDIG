ABSTRACT
During the last decades, the widespread growth of information and communication technologies
(ICT) has posed incentives to broaden the participation of individuals in social, political and
economic dimensions of life. However, utilization of ICT also involves access to technology and
infrastructure, and acquisition of skills to deal with innovations and, thus, digital literacy is,
primarily, a complementary good. The digital divide expresses inequalities in access and
utilization of ICT among individuals and populations in different countries. The study adopts
inequalities indexes of Internet access and mobile phone ownership to measure use of ICT goods,
accounting for the digital divide in Brazil. The inequality indexes are also split according to main
determinants using four nationally representative survey data from 2005 to 2013. Results
indicate that the digital divide among individuals is decreasing quite fast among Brazilians over
time. However, there is room for policies of mass access to ICT goods based on mobile Internet
broadband access. In addition, digital illiteracy, evaluated by lack of education, is one of the
main determinants of the digital divide in the country, especially among elderly individuals.
1. Introduction
The recent widespread growth of informat
tend “to focus on specific groups of people within a nation who appear especially disadvantaged by the digital divide (…) people on
low incomes, people with limited education or low literacy levels, ethnic minorities, the unemployed, the elderly, people in isolated
or rural areas, people with disabilities, single parents, and women and girls” (Zhao et al., 2014, p. 40).
Dewan and Riggins (2005) unfold the digital divide in other two dimensions: inequality in access to ICT and inequality in
capacity of ICT utilization; that is, differences in reaching technological innovations and in ability to use technological devices. Other
authors point to the utilization of the Internet on mobile phones as alternative to reduce the inequality in Internet access (DiMaggio,
Hargittai, Celeste, & Shafer, 2004; Wirthmann, 2012), since differences in access to ICT have been declining faster in relation to
mobile devices than other technologies (technological convergence) (UNCTAD1
).
The present study follows Zhang (2013) to evaluate the Brazilian domestic digital divide, adopting the inequality index to analyze
the relationship between income, Internet access and mobile phone access in the Brazilian population. The inequality of ICT access is
estimated controlling for geographical, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, using nationally representative data. The
National Household Sample Survey (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílio, PNAD), from the Brazilian Institute for
Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, IBGE) in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013, contains information
of individuals and households, including ICT goods utilization. Also, inspired by Dewan and Riggins (2005) dimension of
inequalities in ICT access and capacity of usage, the study includes logistic models to evaluate the disaggregation of digital divide
among individuals in Brazil.
The estimates account for weighted measure of Internet use among different individuals (see James, 2008). Differences in
population size between countries and variations in income among individuals with access to Internet within countries matter for the
proposed concept of digital divide. Also, the influence of digital illiteracy on ICT access is investigated in the case of elderly
individuals (older than 60 years).
Although there is scarcity of information about the digital divide and its determinants in Brazil, it is known that there is a positive
trend in Brazilian's access to multimedia broadband communication in recent years, as well as in its regions (Fig. 1).
The proportion of population covered by mobile 3G according to Brazilian regions from 2005 to 2015 has been increasing also
(Fig. 2). It is important to highlight that, although 4G technologies have been disseminated since 2013, Brazilian regions have not
still completely replaced 3G technology with full coverage. The data show evidence that more developed regions (Southeastern and
Southern Brazil) has higher access to ICT goods in comparison to other regions.
In addition to the introduction, the article includes four additional sections. Section 2 presents the literature review on the
determinants of the digital divide among populations and individuals worldwide. Section 3 outlines the databases and discusses the
methodological strategy adopted in the study. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions of the
study.
2. Literature review
2.1. Digital divide in Brazil and Latin America
According to World Bank data, the Latin American and Caribbean countries’ populations had increased Internet access in 2014,
with 44.0% of the population having access to computers, 50.2% having Internet subscriptions, 9.8% having broadband
subscriptions, and there being 115 subscribers of mobile per 100 people.
In comparison to the population of North America (82.1%, 87.3%, 31.5%, and 117, respectively), and Europe and Central Asia
(74.4%, 79.2%, 23.7% and 126, respectively), the evidence suggests reduction of the technological gap between regions worldwide
with regard to mobile technologies; however, there are still disparities in relation to broadband, Internet and computers access
(Balboni, Rovira, & Vergara, 2011). In Brazil, 52.0% of the population has access to computers, 57.6% have Internet subscription,
11.7% have broadband subscription, and 139 are subscribers of mobile per 100 people.
According to Lutz-Baliamoune (2003), information and communication technology markets in Latin American countries are
characterized by lack of competitiveness. However, the expansion of mobile telephony in Brazil is very striking: according to data
from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE, 2015), 72.8% of the population above 10 years old owned a mobile phone
in 2013.
Furthermore, Internet service was available for at least 90% of the population living in 18 Brazilian states and Brazilian country
capital in 2015, and the remaining states had Internet services coverage ranging from 71% to 88% of the population (Agência
Nacional de Telecomunicações [ANATEL], 2016). Despite the optimistic scenario, high prices of mobile phones with Internet
applications (smartphones and mobile 3G/4G) are still prohibitive and restrict the expansion of the Internet in prepaid sector of the
mobile broadband market.
Macedo (2010) analyzes determinants of broadband access of the Brazilian municipalities and finds a positive impact of social
wellbeing indicators (health, education and income per capita) on broadband access. Balboni et al. (2011) stress the need for
additional empirical studies and use of individual-level data to evaluate the extent and the characteristics of the digital divide in
Latin American and Caribbean countries.

2.2. Determinants of digital divide
Several studies investigate determinants of digital divide among countries worldwide and among individuals within countries.
Results of the studies indicate that the main factors associated with individual and household-level inequalities in ICT access are:
income, age, educational attainment, area of residence, and occupation.
Singh (2004) analyzes determinants of Internet use in Canada using a logit model applied to individual-level data. The results
indicate that age (individuals in age brackets 15–34 and 35–54 years old), family income, educational level, and family of single
parents with children present positive impact on Internet access.
Cerno and Amaral (2006) use a probit model in two stages to correct for selection bias in order to estimate determinants of
Internet demand in Spain, and find that income has positive effect and age has negative effect. Chakraborty and Bosman (2005)
propose the utilization of the Lorenz Curve and the Gini coefficient for measurement of inequality in personal computer ownership in
the United States, using data at national, regional and state levels based on the Census between 1994 and 2001.
Vehovar, Sicherl, Hüsing, and Dolnicar (2006) criticize the utilization of bivariate comparisons for assessment of digital divide,
proposing three different approaches to its measurement: the use of loglinear modeling to address interactions among determinants
of the digital divide, the proposition of a synthetic composite indicator for digital divide measurement, and the use of time-distance
methodology to investigate evolution in digital divide.
Demoussis and Giannakopoulos (2006) use a probit model to estimate the determinants and the extent of use of Internet access
in European countries. The results point to the fact that Internet use is associated with income, age, sex and family size. The Internet
utilization is lower among dial-up users, although it is not affected by costs of the dial-up connection.
Dudek (2007) uses a qualitative response model (probit) for Polish individual-level data with a set of usual explanatory variables
adopted in studies involving the determinants of residential Internet access (income, gender, ethnic group, educational level, age,
location of residence, and presence of children). The study shows that income, educational level and presence of children have a
positive effect on residential Internet access. Rural dwellers and female-headed households are less likely to have residential access.
Wirthmann (2010) analyzes individual-level databases in order to verify differences among individuals in relation to access and
use of ICT, providing valuable information for the application of measures on policy level. Montagnier and Wirthmann (2011)
address digital divide among households and individuals by analyzing ICT usage patterns in 18 European countries, Korea and
Canada. The authors show inequalities in computer and Internet access as result of socioeconomic characteristics through logistic
regression and multi-linear regression models. Income, age, occupation, presence of children in the household, and living in urban
areas are the most important determinants of Internet access. The intensity of Internet utilization is influenced by educational

attainment, being student and income (in Europe) or broadband access (in Korea).
Vicente and López (2011) measure digital divide across and within 27 countries of the European Union, showing that, besides
income, cultural and institutional factors may be determinants in ICT adoption. The European Commission (2012) adopts models of
binary choice to estimate frequency of Internet use based on individual and household-level data from Europe Union, Norway and
Iceland. There are positive associations of Internet use in relation to: i) younger individuals; ii) males; iii) urban regions; iv) higher
income levels; v) employment and participation in the workforce; vi) non-shared Internet access (residential), and vii) broadband.
Loo and Ngan (2012) investigate the impact of mobile communications on digital divide in China. The authors show that mobile
or wireless telecommunications present higher potential of narrowing digital divide in developing countries due to lower costs in
comparison to fixed-line telephone services and personal computers. In addition, adoption of proactive government measures
granting free access to broadband in mobile devices promotes a decrease in digital divide in China after 2005.
Çilan and Özdemir (2013) analyze domestic digital divide in Turkey using Latent Class Analysis. The results indicate that most of
the Turkish population present low information technology competence, being recommended implementation of State policies
designed to encourage elderly individuals to use ICT and to enhance educational attainment of people with low levels of education.
Prieger (2013) describes the extent of digital divide among urban and rural areas in the United States, indicating that rural areas
present a higher number of slow-speed connection providers in comparison to urban areas, which have larger number of high-speed
fixed and mobile providers. Moreover, there is an important influence of household demographics on mobile broadband usage gap.
Pantea and Martens (2013) examine the digital divide in the five largest European Union economies in relation to Internet use,
considering general utilization and specific purposes (leisure, improving human capital and obtaining goods and services). The
authors show a reversion in income-based digital divide referring to Internet use, indicating high intensity of use by low-income
individuals. Also, higher education levels present negative impact on the use of Internet for leisure purposes and positive impact for
educational purposes.
Albuja, Navas, Paguay, Moreno, and Nájera (2015) propose a technological Gini coefficient to identify and analyze the access to
ICT inequality in Ecuador, and use expenditure in ICT services to indicate the consumption flow of ICT products and services, taking
into consideration socioeconomic level. They propose public policies towards promotion of affordability capacities of citizens to ICT
access in the country.
The present study investigates empirically the evolution in inequality of access to information and communication technologies
among Brazilian individuals, based on the information on Internet utilization during the last three months and the ownership of
mobile phone in the period from 2005 to 2013. Additionally, the analysis seeks to indicate the main determinants of digital divide in
Brazil, including socioeconomic and demographic characteristics that may impose barriers to ICT access in the population.
2.3. Impact of elderly digital illiteracy on digital divide
Although it is clear that digital illiteracy represents an important obstacle to implementing digital inclusion policies, it should be
noted that it does not necessarily refer to an intergenerational gap in ICT abilities. Lutz-Baliamoune (2003) argues that utilization of
mobile does not depend on literacy; however, it is important to notice that the study generally refers to mobile use for voice services.
Thus, smartphones present additional challenges in terms of utilization regarding digital literacy due to supplementary applications,
especially among elderly individuals.
In Brazil, approximately 86% of the adult population indicated mobile phone ownership in 2015 (Pew Research Center, 2016),
being smartphone ownership rate approximately 41% among Brazilian adult population, highly concentrated among younger
individuals (61% among individuals between 18 and 34 years old) with higher educational attainment (64%) and higher income
(54%).
According to Santos, Azevedo, and Pedro (2013, p. 179), d
among elderly individuals is a well-established phenomenon in the digital divide literature (Cerno & Amaral, 2006; Demoussis &
Giannakopoulos, 2006; Japan, 2001; Singh, 2004).
2.4. Hypotheses
The hypothesis of the study refers to the evolution and the determinants of digital divide in Brazil between 2005 and 2013,
considering that the digital divide is represented by proxy variables related to ICT utilization: Internet connection and mobile phone
ownership.
In the context of the investigation, the main hypothesis is that there have been significant decreases in digital divide in the
Brazilian population during the period analyzed, mainly due to increasing income per capita and educational attainment. The
assumption is that digital divide determinants in Brazil are related to two dimensions; capacity of ICT utilization (individuals’
characteristics: gender, age group, ethnic group, and educational attainment as a proxy for digital illiteracy), and access to ICT
(external factors: household income per capita, occupation status, households with children and with elderly, household size,
number of household residents, area of residence, and location of the household).
The assumption that population educational level can be a good proxy for digital illiteracy in the Brazilian case is based on Neri
(2003) and McCowan (2007). This because the low level and quality of education among Brazilians are still a challenge to be
overcome, and digital illiteracy is just one piece of illiteracy.
3. Data and methodological strategy
3.1. Data
The study uses individual-level data representative of the Brazilian population from the National Household Sample Surveys
(PNAD), conducted by IBGE during 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013, in order to estimate the evolution of Internet access and personal
mobile phone ownership. Individuals were asked about any access to the Internet in the last three months and mobile phone
ownership for individual use. The datasets also include households and individuals’ characteristics that comprise the main
determinants of Internet utilization services and mobile phone ownership, as highlighted by the literature (Table 1).
The methodological approach of the study uses Deaton (1997) strategy to convert individual income into household income per
capita in adult equivalents, in order to split income available according to the household expenditure needs of each age group.
Individuals younger than 14 years old are computed using a weight of 0.75, in order to generate an equivalence scale (eh):
eA K hh h =( +Φ )θ (1)
where: Ah represents the number of adults in the household h, and Kh represents the number of children in the household h. The
parameters Φ and θ should be equal to 0.75, the weight previously defined by Deaton (1997). Considering that Internet access
depends on the structure of services supply in a large country like Brazil, a check on Internet services available for each state of the
country is performed.
3.2. Methodological strategy
To explore evolution of digital divide and its determinants in Brazil, the investigation follows Zhang (2013) in using an inequality
index, but using a concentration index instead of the Gini index. The analysis performed focus on income-related inequality in access
to information and communication technology (ICT) goods in Brazil. The concentration curve (L), the concentration index (CI), and
the horizontal concentration index (HI) are computed to identify inequality on Internet access and mobile phone ownership,
considering proxy measurements of ICT goods.
Then, logistic regressions are estimated using the concentration index of ICT goods as dependent variable against independent
variables representing individual characteristics and external factors related to ICT access, including socioeconomic, demographic
and geographical variables. Following Wagstaff, van Doorslaer, and Watanabe (2003), the study presents disaggregation of the
concentration index among the main determinants. However, as Dewan and Riggins (2005), the determinants are split into two
dimensions of the inequalities in ICT: access to ICT goods and capacity of ICT usage, corresponding respectively to external factors
and individual characteristics according to Wagstaff et al. (2003), in order to identify the contribution of education, the proxy
measure adopted to represent digital illiteracy.
The concentration curves (L) display the cumulative share of ICT access (y), that is, Internet connection and mobile phone
ownership, accounting for the cumulative proportion of individuals of a population ranked from the poorest to the richest (Kakwani,
1980).
On the other hand, the concentration index (CI) allows to measure inequality according to socioeconomic position of individuals.
The graphic of its curve shape is illustrative of inequality patterns among individuals. The concentration index (CI) may be written
as:
CI ∑nμ = y R 2 −1
i
N
i i
=1 (2)
M. Nishijima et al. Telecommunications Policy 41 (2017) 12–24
16
where µ is the mean of y and Ri is the fractional rank of the i
th person in the income distribution, and N is the sample size.
Finally, it is possible to estimate the horizontal inequality (HI) index to address measurement of inequality between groups of
individuals with different personal characteristics regarding capacity of ICT usage, calculated from the difference between the
concentration index (CI) and the concentration index for the called individuals’ capacity of ICT usage (CN), controlled by individual
characteristics:
HI CI C = − N (3)
In addition, the concentration index may be disaggregated in terms of its determinants by using a set of independent variables
that affect access to ICT goods, according to individual characteristics and external factors (Wagstaff et al., 2003). The CI
disaggregation is estimated using a logit model with the concentration index as dependent variable. The model defines y* as latent
non-observed variable that describes the utilization of ICT goods by the individual, where βk is the coefficient of explicative variable k
and ε is an error term:
y*=β xβ w ′. + ′. +ε 1 2 (4)
Matrix x includes a set of variables of individual characteristics and matrix w includes other independent variables associated
with external factors. It is possible to show that (Wagstaff et al., 2003):

N i i is the generalized concentration index for the residual (ε) and xk is the mean of xk . Two different
specifications of logistic model are tested in order to verify main determinants of access to ICT goods of the Brazilian population. The
observed information of y is defined by:
y=1⟺y yy * > 0 & =0⟺ * ≤ 0 (6)
As already described, the dependent variable (y) in each model describes whether the individual had access to the two types of
ICT goods investigated: i) Internet connection, and ii) mobile phone ownership.
The coefficients (βk) of the non-linear logistic regression model (logit) are estimated, as Dewan and Riggins (2005) indicated,
against individuals’ capacity of ICT utilization (x) and other external factors that determine access to ICT goods (w).
Matrix x includes gender, age group, ethnic group, and educational attainment to measure individuals’ capacity of ICT usage.
Matrix w includes household income per capita, occupation status, households with children and with elderly, household size,
number of persons in the households, area of residence (rural or urban), and location of the household (region and state) to measure
access to ICT goods.
Logistic regression models exclusively for elderly individuals (older than 60 years) are also estimated, in order to account for
elderly's digital illiteracy, evaluated using educational level.
4. Results
The Brazilian population's characteristics show trends related to occurrence of demographic transition, marked by increasing
proportion of elderly individuals, decreasing number of families with children, and reduction of average number of household
members (shown in Table 1). Simultaneously, there are evidences of improvements in socioeconomic trends during the last decade:
higher rates of educational attainment, employment and urbanization among Brazilian individuals. Regarding utilization of ICT,
there is significant increase in Internet access and mobile phone property throughout the period investigated.
The results of logistic regressions referring to determinants of Internet access throughout the period investigated show that, in

general, younger, white and educated individuals, having a higher income levels, and living in larger households (measured by
household size) influences positively the likelihood of Internet access (Table 2).
However, there are significant changes occurring between 2005 and 2013, especially related to the probability of Internet
utilization by women and families with children, which presents changes in effects (from negative to positive) along the decade.
There are evidences of intense Internet usage among youngsters (individuals younger than 15 years old), especially students. Apart
from that, individuals living in rural areas have reduced probability of Internet access, possibly due to lack of infrastructure.
Elderly individuals also have lower access to the Internet; however, it is important to point out that this effect has been reduced
during the period analyzed, especially due to improvements in educational attainment levels among older individuals (shown in
Table 1). That is, considering the convergence of effects from coefficients of age (individuals younger than 15 year old and
individuals older than 60 years old) and educational attainment (years of education), the impact of digital illiteracy in Brazil seems to
be greatly attached to a lack of access to formal education, and less due to difficulties in accessing or using the Internet.
The effect is particularly applicable to the probability of Internet access among elderly individuals, considering that the study
analyzes combined effects of age and education by adopting an interaction variable in the model (Table A1, Appendix A), in order to
test for nonlinear effects of adequacy of educational attainment according to age of the individual. The indicator of educational
attainment per age represents an indicator positively correlated with ICT utilization, since education influences positively ICT
utilization and age influences negatively ICT utilization. The inclusion of the interaction term of education per age shows positive
impact on Internet access probability; however, it significantly reduces the direct effects of age and educational attainment.
It is possible to identify similar effects observed in Internet access referring to the evolution and the main determinants of mobile
property. Higher income and higher education influence positively the probability of mobile phone ownership in Brazil, as well as
being male, white and employed or student (Table 3).
The main differences between the likelihood to own a mobile phone and to have Internet access refers to results for young
individuals (aged under 15 years old), who are less likely to have mobile phones (possibly due to parental concerns), and for
household size, showing that individuals living in households with higher number of family members are less likely to have a mobile
phone. The last result is particularly interesting as it refers to potential strategies of public policy directed at massive Internet access
based on mobile phone property.
However, there is increasing probability of mobile phone ownership among individuals in households with children and
individuals with higher educational attainment, while the effect of income and ethnicity are declining along the period analyzed.

There are evidences of declining effects of certain determinants of mobile phones property (sex and being elderly) along time. The
probability of having a mobile phone has been increasing among the Brazilian population in general (shown in Table 1), turning it
into a device commonly available in comparison to other ICT devices, due to declining prices and its utility on daily tasks.
An important evidence to be highlighted in the estimates of mobile phone ownership refers to barriers in access to certain ICT
goods due to income, educational attainment and, possibly, limitations of the electronic device for specific uses (e.g., Internet
access), especially among elderly individuals. The results show that the probability of mobile phone property has been increasing
along the period analyzed. The latter, however, includes a decrease in the negative effect of being elderly and an increase in the
positive effect of education, indicating that mobile utilization may involve higher complexity in comparison to Internet access.
Furthermore, the results shed light on the promotion of education as public policy strategy to foster access to information and
communication technologies using mobile services, because Brazilian elderly individuals have significantly lower educational
attainment than younger individuals (shown in Table 1). According to the data, trends of increasing educational attainment of the
Brazilian population may help overcome the problem of digital illiteracy, although there is ongoing debate on the quality of
education in Brazil.
Inequalities in personal mobile phone ownership are decreasing sharply over time, especially in comparison to inequalities with
regard to Internet access in Brazil. The digital divide among Brazilian individuals may be minimized by the convergence in ICT
access due to acquisition of electronic devices at lower prices, according to the evolution of inequalities in Internet access and mobile
property in Brazil between 2005 and 2013 (Fig. 3).
The datasets from the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics allow the disaggregation of the effects from diverse
determinants of the concentration index (CI) for Internet access and mobile ownership. Hence, it is possible to identify the main
groups of determinants in inequalities regarding the digital divide among Brazilian individuals: household income per capita and
educational attainment (Figs. 4 and 5).
Educational attainment, considered one of the main dimensions of capacity of ICT utilization, presents an increasing trend along
the period analyzed. Thus, access to information and communication technology may be improved significantly by promoting
education in Brazil.

However, it is important to point out that employment and number of household members are also important determinants of
the inequalities in access to ICT; although the impacts in inequality coefficients related to income, employment and number of
household members have been declining during recent years (Figs. 4 and 5).
The results may be related to the digital convergence due to reduction of prices of ICT goods, one of many consequences of
technological convergence/evolution, allowing improvement of access among poorest individuals in the Brazilian population along
time.
Additionally, geographic localization (including state and urban/rural areas) shows an increasing trend as determinant of
inequalities on Internet access and mobile property. The results indicate that, although statistics from the Brazilian
Telecommunications Agency (Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações, ANATEL) demonstrate growing broadband access and 3 G
coverage, there are still significant infrastructural differences according to regional location.
Coefficients of concentration indexes (CI) and horizontal inequality (HI) indicate that inequality is decreasing both on Internet
access and on mobile property along time (Table 4). Recently, mobile ownership reaches a significantly lower degree of general
inequality (CI2013=10%) in comparison to Internet access (CI2013=19%).
Except personal characteristics that may limit the capacity of ICT utilization, HI indicators bring evidence of inequalities
referring to external factors, that is, excluding the effects of individual's skills (especially educational attainment in the case of the
Brazilian population).
The coefficients of concentration indexes (CI) and horizontal inequality (HI) for elderly individuals are also presented in order to
verify the impact of ageing on Internet access and on mobile property, promoting an intergenerational digital divide in Brazil. It is
possible to note higher coefficients for elderly individuals, specially referring to the general determinants of ICT access
(concentration indexes), connected with low level of education.
Referring to personal capacity of ICT utilization, represented by the difference between concentration index and horizontal
inequality, it is possible to notice convergence of inequality coefficients for mobile phone ownership between the general population
and elderly individuals; showing that mobile phone property is limited by external factors more than by personal skills among the
whole Brazilian population.
Regarding Internet access, the results confirm recent concerns with elderly digital illiteracy. Although formal education has been

increasing among elderly individuals along the period analyzed, educational attainment is still significantly lower among elderly in
comparison to the general Brazilian population. Lower educational attainment associated with lower household income per capita
are important limiting factors to Internet access among elderly individuals, due to costs and skills required to obtain broadband
connection in Brazil.
Comparing inequality levels between Internet access and mobile phone property, it is possible to verify that Internet access
presents higher concentration indexes due to socioeconomic determinants in Brazil than mobile ownership during the period
analyzed (Table 4, Fig. 3). The result reinforces the potential for adoption of mass Internet access policy based on granting free
wireless broadband access in public places, which has been proposed by governments of certain Brazilian cities, grounded on
examples from other countries.
Another public policy strategy that may disseminate mass Internet access among the Brazilian population and promote equality
in information and communication technology utilization might be the implementation of incentives (subsidies or tax discounts) for
household Internet subscription and/or acquisition of personal mobile phone with Internet connection (smartphone), although its
utilization may present certain limitations in comparison to computer-based access to the Internet.
The identification of technological convergence patterns on mobile ownership in Brazil, similar to other countries (Khalil &
Kenny, 2008), may support evidences of reduction in the digital divide among the Brazilian population, particularly referring to
socioeconomic obstacles, excluding digital illiteracy. Aspects related to personal capacity of ICT utilization should be addressed
specifically through education policies, including assessment of education quality.
5. Discussion
The main goal of the paper is to perform an empirical investigation on the evolution of the digital divide among Brazilian
individuals, including its main determinants, using valuable survey data representative at national level from 2005, 2008, 2011 and
2013. Inequality in Internet access and mobile phone property among individuals of the Brazilian population represent the digital
divide in using information and communication technologies (ICT) goods available in Brazil.
The study also seeks to fill the gap in empirical studies using individual and household-level data on Internet access and personal mobile
phone property in Latin American countries, according to recommendations published by the United Nations (Balboni et al., 2011).
Two dimensions of the digital divide are investigated in the study: inequality in access to ICT and inequality in capacity of ICT
utilization. The results of logistic models estimated using the Brazilian datasets allow the disaggregation into main determinants of
inequality indexes for ICT access. The evolution of the digital divide assessed by inequality indexes and its disaggregation suggests
that: i) education is the main barrier for personal capacity of ICT goods utilization, being connected to digital illiteracy; and ii)
income, employment and number of household members are major barriers to access ICT goods.
However, the impact of external barriers to ICT access has been declining in recent years; whilst effect of educational attainment remains
expressive throughout time. The results show that education accounts for the majority of inequalities in personal skills for ICT utilization,
that is, improvements in education policy represent an effective strategy to reduce the digital divide among individuals of the Brazilian
population in the long run by reducing barriers related to digital illiteracy, evidence that is supported by Davies et al. (2003).
Regarding the challenges of ageing, digital illiteracy has been considered the main restriction for ICT utilization among elderly
individuals (Cerno & Amaral, 2006; Demoussis & Giannakopoulos, 2006; Faria, 1991; Goldani, 2004; Japan, 2001; Singh, 2004).
The results of the study suggest that digital illiteracy, measured by years of education, has negative impact on Internet access among
elderly individuals; however, the effect of ageing is declining in Brazil along the period from 2005 to 2013.
Furthermore, the effect of ageing is significantly higher in reference to mobile phone property in comparison to Internet access,
showing that computer-based Internet access may be more useful for elderly individuals than mobile-based Internet access. The
barriers to mobile phone property among elderly individuals in Brazil concentrate on external factors linked to ICT goods
acquisition, according to horizontal inequality coefficients estimated.
That is, low income and high costs to purchase mobile phones and possibly difficulties in using applications in smartphones affect

the ability to overcome the digital divide among elderly individuals; especially considering extended uses of smartphones other than
voice services, activities that need large screens. However, the impact of ageing in digital divide tends to decline along time in Brazil
due to effect of schooling, because the educational attainment of younger individuals is higher than the educational achievements
observed currently among elderly individuals in Brazil.
Although barriers of access to ICT have been declining due to digital convergence and prices reduction, the findings of the
investigation corroborate that adoption of short-term public policy for promoting mobile Internet access is suitable for Brazil,
according to the proposal of the Knowledge Society. Although there are limitations to Internet access by mobile phone for certain
purposes, the supply of free Internet access in public places may promote reduction in digital divide observed with regard to Internet
access among diverse socioeconomic groups in the Brazilian population.
Additionally, the study allows the analysis of possibilities to increase equality in access to information and communication
technologies in the country through public policies based on incentives for household Internet subscription and/or acquisition of
personal mobile phones with Internet connection, especially based on reduction of taxes on ICT goods, since there are still high taxes
in Brazil applied to ICT products, which are considered to be similar to games and entertainment goods (i.e., sin taxes).
In sum, the study brings important evidences of evolution and determinants of the digital divide in Brazil, providing
contributions to support the development of innovative strategies in ICT policy that address the reduction of inequalities in access
to ICT and the minimization of inequalities in capacity of ICT utilization. The evidences suggest that there is room for short-term
policy for promotion of mass Internet utilization in Brazil, in order to reduce the share of digital divide in ICT access attributable to
costs of ICT goods acquisition. A limitation of the study refers to the utilization of educational level of individuals as a measure of
digital literacy. However, it is important to point out the absence of other proxy variables in Brazilian databases representative at
population level. In addition, as the Brazilian educational level and quality are still low, it is reasonable to pose that it accounts for
the major part of difficulties in digital literacy yet.
Mobile technology is improving quickly, outgrowing some of its important limitations related to Internet utilization. Considering
that the purpose of mass Internet access is to incentive the spread of information, the adoption of public policies that encourage
mobile Internet access may also enhance individuals’ social support network and economic opportunities. Mobile broadband access
enables individuals to have access to relevant information and communication tools that may be carried out with fairly regular
quality of access anywhere, at any time.
