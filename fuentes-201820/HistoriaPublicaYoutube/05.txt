The social media landscape:
Performing citizenship online
On a cloudy afternoon I met Andres, Francisca and her fiancé Franklin
in the main plaza before walking to a colación take- away restaurant. We
entered the front of the shop and paid $3,000 CLP (US$5) each to the
cashier, who handed us tickets to claim our food at the counter. There we
peered through the cloudy glass at the possible offerings: beef, pan- fried
chicken, noodles with pesto sauce, potatoes with mayonnaise, lettuce, rice
and the typical Chilean salad consisting of tomatoes, onions and coriander.
I gave my order of chicken, noodles and salad at the counter, then sat next
to the other three on folding chairs along the wall. As we waited for the
white polystyrene boxes containing our lunches to be put into plastic bags,
we all simultaneously scrolled through Facebook on our mobile phones.
Francisca began giggling at her cousin’s new profile picture, in which she
was striking an uncharacteristically serious pose. Franklin looked over
her shoulder, commenting ‘It looks like a Fotolog picture’ – a reference
to an online photo sharing site popular in the early 2000s. ‘Oh, Fotolog!’
laughed Andres. ‘The good old days. Remember Terra? Remember chat?’
As we walked back to the apartment with our packaged lunches,
Andres reminisced:
When I was in high school we all began using chat. We had groups, so
you’d just write ‘hello’ and throw it out there. We did that the whole
time in school, everyone chatting like that. Before that it was just
on paper. You pass the paper to someone during free time in school,
and then they give you an answer later. How boring right! It was like
that in Alto Hospicio before internet. When internet arrived it was
massive. It was 1999, maybe 1998, when it started in a basic way.
And people started using chat in Terra [Networks], with that horrible
sound the weeeeee- dum- dum- uuuuuuuu [imitating dial- up modem
noise].

After I revealed that I had never heard of Fotolog or Terra, the three
began explaining to me the different internet- based communications that
had been popular in Alto Hospicio over the years. The very first web portal
was Terra, which allowed for text- based communication in an open
chat forum. Shortly after MSN messenger arrived. Around the same time
the photo- posting site Fotolog became popular, particularly because it
allowed users to receive updates about their FFs, or favourite friends.
Hospiceños began using IRC chat, which offered channels for individual
cities in Chile. Next Latin Chat took over as the most used network; it
provided different discussion forums, based on location, but also interest
(beauty, films, football) or different sexual preferences (including ‘erotic’,
gay, lesbian and group sex). This was also the time of Sexy- o- No, a site on
which one could vote on others’ uploaded photographs as ‘sexy’ or ‘not’.
‘I always got “sexy”!’ Andres boasted as he raised his arms in victory.
With our lunches spread out on the table, and a 3- litre bottle of
Coca Cola shared among us, the three continued to recount the history
of social media sites used in Alto Hospicio. Around 2005 everything
seemed to change, as people moved from simpler, text- based or picturebased
internet interaction to platforms that combined everything –
chatting, picture sharing, videos and commentary. There was a ‘big
jump to MySpace in those days,’ said Franklin as he took a bite of potato.
‘Remember Badoo?’ asked Francisca and the two men nearly squealed
with excitement. ‘Badoo. Badoo! Oh it was much better than MySpace,’
said Andres. ‘And the video boom was around then too!’
YouTube and Google video sharing had become very popular, but
more importantly the site El Rellano began aggregating user- uploaded
funny videos of pets doing silly things and people getting hit by sports
equipment. Blogs allowed people to combine all of these aspects of
the internet as well, enabling users to share videos, upload their own
pictures and write short commentaries. Friends could (indeed were
expected to) comment. The popularity of these early blogs eventually
led to the use of Tumblr. ‘Finally Facebook arrived in 2008,’ said Andres
as he laid down his fork and refilled his glass with soda.
‘So Facebook is the most important social media today?’ I asked,
trying to spur on the discussion. Andres explained:
Social media today, well it’s a lot like a colación. You don’t want all
the same thing. It’s better if you have a mixture. But you don’t want
just a tiny amount of everything. You have to choose. And some
things are more important. For example, you can’t have social media
without Facebook. You can’t have a colación without the meat.

‘And what if you’re vegetarian?’ Francisca challenged him. Franklin
jumped in, ‘Then you have Google+! It’s not Facebook, but the people
who use it think it’s just as good.’
With this colourful history, the three not only gave me a sense of
how important different forms of internet- based communications had
been over the last 15 years. They also revealed the ways in which new
forms of communications media had been quickly taken up and normalised.
Such technology is almost seamlessly integrated into daily
lives, until the next big ‘boom’ comes along and something new is rapidly
adopted. Overall their account demonstrates the ways in which new
media do not significantly shift individuals’ lives, but simply become
new conduits for enduring practices. In particular social media constitute
a new – and possibly the most important – public sphere in which
notions of citizenship are performed and debated, all while reproducing
the forms of normativity most prevalent in the city.
Modernity and mass communications in Chile
Andres, Francisca and Franklin’s story of internet communications in
Alto Hospicio was only the most recent chapter of a much longer history
of mass communications in Chile. The country has always been in
the vanguard of telecommunications in South America, coinciding with
urban Chileans’ propensity to represent their country as a forerunner of
modernity on the continent. In 1852, just 15 years after the commercial
electrical telegraph was invented, the first telegraph message was sent
in Chile. The next year the telegraph service became public. Chileans
began to use telephones in the 1880s and underwater cables were laid
in the 1890s.1
Chile is currently one of the most engaged social media markets
worldwide, averaging 9.5 hours per day per visitor to social media sites.
In fact the country ranks as the third most highly penetrated market for
Facebook in the world, behind the Philippines and Turkey. Florencio
Utrera from the University of Chile was credited with introducing the
internet to Chile in 1992. Its use spread quickly due to deregulated
telecommunications, which encouraged private companies to compete
over prices and services. Widespread usage began in urban areas in the
north of the country by the end of the decade. Throughout the 1990s
the Chilean government controlled prices, expanded internet usage
in schools and offered internet training to NGOs, government officials
and businesses. Today Chile has the highest rate of overall broadband

connection penetration in Latin America, and government projects continue
to dedicate resources. On 28 June 2013 former President Sebastián
Piñera announced he would focus on increasing the national number of
users to bring the internet to 80 per cent of Chilean homes. He promised
to lower connection costs and expand high speed broadband, providing
free Wi- Fi in every community throughout the country.2
Logically this high penetration of internet access places Chileans
quite centrally in global media participation, but Alto Hospicio and the
entire Great North of Chile continue to lag behind. While many communities
have free Wi- Fi access in their central plazas, for example, there
are no free Wi- Fi points in Alto Hospicio. A few internet shops offer their
connected desktop computers available for hire in ten- minute intervals,
but there are no restaurants or cafes with Wi- Fi available to customers.
Even the small, rarely used library lacks Wi- Fi access and provides no
computer terminals for patrons. Many Hospiceños also complain that
data service on mobile phones is less than adequate in the North. When
my neighbour Alvaro returned from a trip to visit family in Santiago he
told me: ‘The networks are so much better there. I could even use the
internet on my phone to make video calls. And the image was clear! If
I try to do the same thing here [in Alto Hospicio], the call just drops.’
Often Hospiceños are left to work out their own ways of connecting
to the internet. Many people place larger antennas on their roofs
to capture a better signal when their internet is very slow. Others hire
their neighbours or unlicensed ‘companies’ to make similar modifications.
Self- engineered internet access has also been popular since the
early 2000s, when home internet connections first became available
in Alto Hospicio. Diego, an electrician in his late thirties, explained to
me how he had personally wired his house for internet in 2001. Rather
than pay a company to come to the house and connect the signal, he and
some neighbours ran wires from the centre of the city to their houses
themselves. He described the process of climbing up on roofs to reach
the wires, then stringing them in zigzag fashion from street to street for
about a kilometre until they reached his neighbourhood. ‘It was pretty
much an expedition just to get internet to the house,’ he told me. Now
most people have home internet installed by company technicians, but
there are still some neighbourhoods in Alto Hospicio where wired internet
service is not available. Families in these areas rely on their mobile
phones for service. Yet even in neighbourhoods where internet is easily
installed, a significant number of people admit that they clandestinely
use other people’s Wi- Fi networks.

In my survey of 100 internet users3 67 per cent of respondents
reported that they had Broadband access in their homes. Another
10 per cent tethered their mobile phone to a computer for internet service
and five per cent said that they used a neighbour’s Wi- Fi signal.
Eighteen per cent said they had no internet access on a computer in their
homes. Unlike in many other Latin American contexts, internet shops
are fairly rare. Most of them are located in the centre of the city rather
than dispersed throughout the neighbourhoods – surprising given that

the neighbourhoods still without wired internet are those furthest from
the centre. Those that still operate often have very limited hours and
primarily cater to groups of secondary school students.
Smartphones are much more important to the ways in which residents
of Alto Hospicio use social media and the internet in general. For
most it is the only electronic device that is theirs alone. In my survey of
social media users, only 14 per cent of people reported using a computer or
tablet of their own. For all others, these internet access points are shared
with parents, siblings, spouses or children. Mobile phones remain highly
personal, however, with monthly data plans starting at around $10,000
CLP ($16 US). Most Hospiceños who have a plan pay around $25,000 CLP
($40 US), which allows them enough phone minutes and text messages
for average use. However, some individuals such as Diego complain that
the internet allotment of 1 GB is not enough for this price. He told me:
The companies abuse the cost of the packages because they charge
you for so many call minutes that nobody uses any more, or text
messages, but they don’t give you enough internet. Hardly anyone
uses minutes any more, but they charge you, they charge you, they
charge you.
However, others consider those with a plan lucky. In order to sign a contract,
a customer must have a national credit card – itself restricted to
those who can prove stable employment in a registered business and a
particular level of income. Because of these constraints, a limited number
of Hospiceños qualify for a monthly plan. Others opt for prepaid
minutes, which can be purchased at any number of small shops in Alto
Hospicio. For $10,000 CLP customers receive about 1 GB of data and a
limited number of text messages and call time. Usually most of the minutes
and messages go unused, and the phone owner buys a new allocation
when their internet quota runs out.
As Diego’s complaint reveals, the costs of internet access are no
small matter to residents of Alto Hospicio. While many families can
afford data plans and used smartphones, at times the monthly budget
does not stretch. For other families, phone- based internet is simply out
of the question. Most recent Bolivian immigrants in Alto Hospicio forego
social media altogether, instead buying international phone credit for
their simple mobiles to call the landlines of family and friends across
the border. Not only is paying for internet service (either broadband or
mobile phone data) a concern for many people: their points of access –
the screens on which they connect – also create tension at times.

Such unequal access to internet- based applications, along with
the shared nature of many screens, further normalises what appears on
public social media. Eclipsing the most marginalised sectors of society,
including immigrants and the severely impoverished, has an effect of
further entrenching a sense of homogenous marginality rather than
supporting identity politics online. Yet the great lengths to which most
people go to access social media, whether sharing a computer with the
family, saving up to buy a smartphone or finding an internet shop to connect,
underlines both how important they are as well as how normative
they have become. Their significance goes beyond merely staying in
touch. Social media offers a space to express something deeper, about
the self, about personal relationships and about how one sees one’s position
in the world.
Defining social media
Andres, Francisca and Franklin’s descriptions make clear that Hospiceños
use a variety of social media in various ways. Social media platforms
are used for writing public announcements, sending personal messages,
sharing photographs, alerting friends to news items, conveying one’s
mood via music, drawing attention to videos of interest or expressing
a commonly held sentiment with a meme. Social media platforms are
also important for communicating agreement or disagreement, or for
developing relationships through phatic communication4 such as ‘liking’,
‘favouriting’, sharing, commenting or even tagging and mentioning people
in response to others’ original posts.5
Many platforms allow for several of these different actions, and
most actions can be performed using a number of different platforms.
One platform may have multiple ways of interacting with friends – sharing
posts, ‘liking’ a friend’s status, chatting and tagging photographs. At the
same time a single form of communication, such as writing messages,
can be accomplished on various different sites and platforms. Even
beyond online media, communication happens through a mixture of
speaking in person, using more ‘traditional’ technology, such as the telephone
or text messaging, and through internet- based social media. In
Alto Hospicio, as across the world, social media is not opposed to, but is
integrated with, communications in everyday life.
Early studies of the internet often conceptualised a ‘virtual world’
as separate from ‘real life’. Yet Hospiceños understand that their online
interactions are just as real and important as their offline lives. Just as

a telephone conversation or email does not constitute a separate realm,
social media are simply part of a more expansive communication landscape.
Because these categories merge into one another and daily life, it
is useful to define exactly what we mean by social media.
As used in this book, social media refers to platforms such
as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram and interactive blogs.
However, defining social media based only on platforms that presently
exist is limiting. As Miller et al suggest, social media are those
forms of communication that provide a middle ground between public
broadcasting and private communication. Before this technology, each
communication medium was often either unidirectional and aimed at
a large audience, as in television, radio and newspapers, or was interactive
but private in nature, such as telephone conversations or letters.
With the development of social media, individuals can choose the size
of their audience (ranging from one to billions) and level of interaction
they wish. This ‘scalable sociality’6 gives individuals more control over
their self- representations to different audiences.
For example, on Facebook an individual may choose to make a
photograph visible only to their ‘close friends’, but to share a meme with
an unlimited public. Twenty- two year old Lisette, for example, is somewhat
private about her new romantic relationship with Isadora. When
Lisette posts pictures of the two making funny faces together or sharing
a meal, she allows them to be publicly visible. When she posts pictures
of the two kissing or holding hands, however, she restricts their visibility
to only her closest friends. She is fairly open about her sexuality with her
family and close friends, but does not always trust a much wider social
media audience with what she considers a sensitive subject.
Facebook, sometimes called just Face, is the most popular social
media platform.7 This is because, as many Hospiceños explain, it combines
the ability to post visual materials with text status updates and
interactive features such as ‘liking’ posts, commenting and private messaging.
For many people in northern Chile, it is central to their daily
communications. Because of its widespread use, Facebook is the sphere
in which people maintain relationships, as well as express their individual
personalities and participate as citizens of the community.8
Alvaro, who moved with his brother and mother to Alto Hospicio
from Santiago in 2005, uses Facebook to keep in touch with family and
particularly with his ten- year- old son Daniel, who remains in Santiago
with Alvaro’s ex- girlfriend. When Daniel turned eight Alvaro helped
him set up his own Facebook account so they can share pictures and chat
almost daily. This private communication is important, but Alvaro also

uses Facebook to express his interests, posting his own short reviews of
the latest movies, as well as memes highlighting what he sees as unjustifiable
policies that extend social services to new immigrants. He also
takes advantage of his position as a manager of a small electronics store
in the Zofri mall to publicly share pictures of sale prices on computers,
speakers, televisions, video game systems and even alcohol that he sees
around the mall. His friends often thank him in the comments for his
‘public service’ in advertising special deals to a broader public. Facebook
thus allows Alvaro different levels of broadcasting, from privately conversing
with Daniel to sharing pictures publicly. However, these levels
only exist because Facebook provides the possibility of a seemingly
unlimited public.
The public nature of Facebook provides a ‘public sphere’9 not only
for individuals, but also for businesses, politicians and community
groups. Official social groups and businesses take advantage of Facebook
for various forms of publicity or to stay connected to the community. The
volunteer leaders of ‘La Escuelita’ [The Little School] – an after- school
programme operating in one of the poorest neighbourhoods of Alto
Hospicio – began a Facebook page that they fill with announcements
and pictures of special events they organise for the children, including
breakdancing lessons, special crafts days and trips to the beach. They
also use Facebook to promote their fundraising efforts such as selling
home- made veggie burgers. The programme is run by several social
work students from a university in Iquique, many of whom grew up or
currently live in Alto Hospicio. They see Facebook as integral to the aims
of La Escuelita, and make all posts on the page as public as possible.
This is in part because their mission involves giving the neighbourhood’s
children a better chance at a positive future, but it also serves to promote
a sense of community founded in collectively making the most of their
marginalised conditions.
Raquel, a local social worker and community activist in her late
twenties, ran for an office in the Consejo Regional [Regional Council]
in the 2013 election cycle. In addition to the posters she and her friends
hung up all over Alto Hospicio and Iquique, Raquel opened a separate
Facebook account where she displayed her slogan and logo, explained
her platform – which consisted mostly of improving community services
– and linked to news articles relating to her campaign and the
election in general. Even after losing the election, Raquel keeps this
account open to share public, politically related news and maintains
her personal Facebook account full of pictures with family and friends.
Keeping the two accounts separate allows her to separate her personal

life from her political and professional life, and cater her posts to two
different audiences.
Facebook is important for businesses based in Alto Hospicio as
well. Gonz, who began a sushi10 delivery business with his brother Victor,
explained that Facebook allows them to publish menus, advertise on
other pages and even take orders. They began the business after a major
earthquake when the highway to Iquique was impassable, ‘providing
an opportunity’ for Hospiceños to get sushi when their access to restaurants
in Iquique was cut off. Gonz works all day preparing sushi at home.
Then, from 7pm onwards, the two brothers are ready to take orders on
their mobile phones and laptops. When someone sends a Facebook or
WhatsApp message with an order, the brothers put sushi rolls into plastic
boxes and send them with Gonz’s son to be delivered. Facebook has
proved especially useful for advertising specials or even giving special
offers to regular customers. ‘It only gets complicated when my friends
write during the shift and I don’t know if they want to order or just want
to say hi!’ Gonz told me. He now says he regrets combining his personal
and business pages, but it certainly has not negatively affected the business.
Over the course of my 15 months of field work the two brothers
started in Gonz’s kitchen, then moved to their parents’ much larger
kitchen. After recruiting several family members to help out, they were
still overwhelmed with orders and had to hire two additional people,
making the business an eight- person operation that continues to grow.
For individuals, politicians, businesses and community groups,
Facebook is a way to express citizenship – by publicly voicing allegiance
to certain local political issues and by helping the community, even if
only alerting them to special deals in Zofri. Facebook, then, is a key public
sphere in which Hospiceños perform a normative style of marginalised
citizenship.
Individuals also use WhatsApp to parse out different sizes and levels
of intimacy in their intended audience. WhatsApp is used much like
‘traditional’ text messaging, but has added benefits of sending photographs,
video and voice messages, managing groups and using emojis, as
well as using mobile data rather than a messaging bundle. When I began
field work in 2013 WhatsApp was just taking hold; by the time I finished
in 2015 Hospiceños considered it almost as important as Facebook.11
When I met new people, including police officers, internet installation
technicians and neighbours, they almost always asked if I had WhatsApp
rather than wanting to connect through email, Facebook or telephone.
WhatsApp has become especially important for families in which at
least one member works in the mining industry. The mining operations

are about 300 km (four hours by bus) away from Alto Hospicio, so the
overwhelmingly male mining employees work one week at the mine
with one week off. Vicky’s husband Jorge, for instance, has worked in a
copper mine doing maintenance on large machinery for over 20 years.
Every other Monday night he takes a bus to the mine. Until the following
Sunday he sleeps in a dormitory room that he shares with three other
miners and eats his meals in the company cafeteria. He works from 8am
to 8pm each day, then showers, eats dinner and usually watches videos
on his computer before sleeping. His son Alex and son- in- law José
both work in the same mine. Their schedules overlap, so Jorge is able
to spend some evenings joking and playing cards with them. In order to
stay in contact with his wife Vicky, daughter Gabriela and his grandson
Samuel, however, WhatsApp is ideal. Jorge has a Facebook account, but
rarely uses it. Instead he passes the night sending messages to his family
in Alto Hospicio on WhatsApp, and receiving replies from his wife and
daughter, often with pictures of Samuel.
Jorge’s son Alex uses Facebook more than his father, but told me
that WhatsApp is especially important for chatting with his girlfriend
Carmela. He also uses WhatsApp to stay in contact with friends in Alto
Hospicio, creating groups in order to stay a part of their daily, usually
joking conversations. Alex appreciates this most on really boring days
at work, because his friends send him funny videos or memes through
WhatsApp to keep him entertained. He also uses WhatsApp to plan
activities with Carmela, his friends and his family for his weeks off.
WhatsApp is also useful for actually doing work. Alex, who works
in motor maintenance like his father, explained to me that living quarters
and the offices at the mine are located far from the work sites; workers
sometimes have to travel long distances between sites for specific
projects. When he first started at the mine in the late 1990s, things were
very inefficient because of the distances workers needed to travel. He
explained:
WhatsApp is perfect, because supervisors can just send you a
message. Before you’d start out in the office and they’d tell you to
go fix a motor that’s a 10 or 20- minute drive. So you’d get there
and discover that you’re missing a part, or the motor is different
than you thought so you need different tools. Well, there was no
way to call, so you had to drive all the way back to get what you
needed. And sometimes you had to do that two or three times.
Now you just send a WhatsApp to your friend and they bring it
out to you.

As noted above, businesses such as Gonz and Victor’s sushi delivery
company also use WhatsApp to take orders. Other business owners
see an invaluable asset in the potential of privacy that WhatsApp offers.
When I arrived in Alto Hospicio in 2013 there was only one bar in the
city, open only on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. By the time
I finished field work in 2015 Carlos had opened two bars near the centre
of the city, both serving customers six nights a week. He often gives
away specials in the bars, enticing customers to take selfies at the bar
and post them on the business’s Facebook page. ‘But the most interesting
things happen on WhatsApp,’ he told me mysteriously.
In addition to the two bars Carlos also owns a strip club, which
women are prohibited from entering. The club has a Facebook page, but
many clients thought it was too public, so he now uses Facebook less
and WhatsApp more, creating a private group where he advertises special
events such as dancers from Arica or Antofagasta. The group has
over 200 members who also use WhatsApp to post funny and sexually
explicit memes and rowdy teasing conversations anonymously, turning
the app into a virtual boys’ club. ‘It’s just nice to have some privacy, and
while Facebook is good for most things, WhatsApp lets the men be men
without worrying,’ he observed.
Though less public than Facebook, WhatsApp also provides a
means through which individuals express certain ways of identifying,
whether as a part of a family or work- related identification. Of course
it also provides a more covert way of engaging with others, for matters
that may be considered contrary to ‘good’ heteronormative citizenship.12
Thus the ways in which Carlos uses social media for his businesses
demonstrates how a combination of different media options further
allows for maintaining an image of good citizenship in the public eye.
As Carlos’s story reveals, group functions of WhatsApp are particularly
useful to limiting the reach of certain kinds of communication.
However, other platforms are well- suited for making broadcasts as public
as possible. Though Instagram and Twitter are less popular in Alto
Hospicio, individuals still take advantage of these platforms when hoping
to gain a wide audience for their messages.
Twitter, the third most popular platform in Alto Hospicio,13 is
used to share links, photographs, text limited to 140 characters or simply
to ‘re- tweet’ another user’s original post. Twitter also allows users
to add hashtags to note the important topics of their post and make it
searchable, but Hospiceños rarely use this feature. Hospiceños generally
use Twitter as another way of writing status messages or perhaps
linking to photographs, much as they use Facebook. Though the Iquique

newspaper (Alto Hospicio has no newspaper of its own), local radio stations,
members of local government and a few individuals regularly post
news items relevant to the region, not many Hospiceños follow these
Twitter accounts, reflecting the fact that news is simply not an important
use of social media in general. Rather people tend to get plenty of news
from televisions and radios that seem to play constantly in almost every
house, restaurant, public bus, collective and private taxi in the city.
Twitter use also seems to suffer from the fact that Hospiceños say
the page view itself is boring. On Facebook and other visually centred
platforms images such as personal photographs and memes are central
to the application’s appearance. On Twitter the page is dominated by
text on a white background; many users say their eyes become fatigued
quickly just looking at the page. Twitter does not offer the entertainment
and distraction value equal to platforms with more image- centric
layouts, thus earning it the title of the most fome [boring] social media
option. So even those Hospiceños that use Twitter see it as secondary to
other social networking sites where they concentrate more energy.
Yesenia, a mother of three who works for Alto Hospicio’s municipal
government, often uses Twitter as part of her job. Though she tweets
only occasionally, she keeps the application on her phone and follows
all the local news outlets, regional and national government and several
businesses in Alto Hospicio. She is very involved with senior citizens
in Alto Hospicio, and always tweets announcements about activities
she organises for older members of the community. Yet pictures of the
‘Advanced Adult Beauty Pageant’, as well as celebrations for various holidays,
are always reserved for Facebook. For Yesenia Twitter is a tool
for organising, while Facebook is the space in which she reflects on the
activities as part of enjoyment of life.
Yesenia’s son Cristian also uses Twitter regularly, but in a very different
way. He is among the teens who often replicate their Facebook
status updates on Twitter. On Twitter he expresses feelings including
happiness, excitement, disappointment or frustration with the normal
events of life; he cheers on his favourite football team, Colo Colo, or just
whiles away time to avoid boredom, as many young people do on social
media. Cristian connects with friends by following them on Twitter and
occasionally mentioning them in his tweets, but rarely uses hashtags.
Instead of using Twitter to access wider networks, it is simply one more
space much like Facebook where he can interact with his school friends
online. For both Yesenia and Cristian, Twitter acts as a way to place
themselves within the community – yet they also realise that Twitter
is not a primary public sphere in which that community is present.

They thus give minimal emphasis to the application, leaving time and
energy for those that are more central to the performance of citizenship
in Alto Hospicio.
Instagram is also primarily used by younger people14 and is exclusively
image- focused. Users can post photographs that are modified
through cropping and changing lighting and colour tones. Unlike Twitter,
however, Hospiceños use hashtags (#) extensively on Instagram, often
giving the location such as #InstaHospicio or #InstaChile, in addition
to other photo descriptors such as #beach, #work, #school or #family.
One popular use of Instagram is family photographs and specifically pictures
of children. Tamara, originally from Southern Chile, is particularly
fond of posting selfies with her four- year- old daughter Angela, and occasionally
with her husband Luis. She also posts pictures of Iquique’s main
beach when she has the chance to go, but more often the pictures depict
her daily life: grocery shopping, her job selling clothing in the large
Agro- market of Alto Hospicio or relaxing at home watching television.
Other Instagram users focus their posts on particular themes.
When Jhony, a member of the Zorros Rojos [Red Foxes] Motor Club,
bought a large Samsung tablet phone, he took it to an asado barbeque
with his fellow motor club members. Over Escudo beers and smoke from
the grill, everyone gave Jhony suggestions for applications to download.
After creating a WhatsApp group to organise events with the club,
Miguel suggested he install Instagram. ‘What’s Instagram for?’ asked
Jhony. Miguel explained, ‘You upload pictures and the whole world says
“I like it!” It’s good for self- esteem.’ Paul, another member of the group
added, ‘You take pictures of ugly people like us and we come out looking
good. It works like magic.’ Jhony downloaded Instagram and took a
few pictures at the asado. Later, however, he started exclusively to post
pictures of his motorcycle and truck. While Facebook remains his main
form of social media communication, where he posts funny memes, photos
from parties and comments on friends’ posts, Instagram is reserved
for showing off his vehicles.
For Hospiceños, Instagram is less about interpersonal communication
and more about expression and performance. It becomes a place
to express normative aesthetics, lifestyles and hobbies – in many ways
reflecting the normativity of Alto Hospicio, without opening up conversations
about that normativity.
Because functions of different kinds of social media overlap, and
many of the platforms offer more than one function, it is hard to conceive
of one social media platform in isolation. Rather each is understood
as part of the colación that Andres described. His description

acknowledges that with a variety of communication technologies
at one’s disposal, each media is defined and used in relation to other
available media, a point encompassed in the term ‘polymedia’.15 Most
people use a combination of several to achieve various communication
aims. Some messages are aimed at a wide local audience (such as public
Facebook posts) and others at anonymous, possibly international viewers
(such as Instagram pictures and Twitter messages), while still others
are intended for a very specific, small, known audience (Facebook messages
only visible to certain friends, or WhatsApp messages to individuals
or small groups). It is the ability to combine these different sizes
of audience, along with different genres – such as photographs, videos,
shared memes, original text and copied, shared text – that give social
media its flexible qualities.16
Alejandra is a leader of a folkloric group, which performs a dance
called Caporales. The dance itself has its origins in Bolivia, and there
is even an official organisation which coordinates costumes and specific
dance moves in the Bolivian capital of La Paz. Social networking
sites in general become indispensable for Alejandra and her group – for
communicating
with the central organisation on Facebook, ordering
costumes and planning trips to perform through WhatsApp and publicising
their group by posting photographs on Instagram. YouTube is also
important for groups outside of La Paz to learn the official dance steps
that change slightly year to year. Alejandra explained that the central
organisation makes a video of the group in La Paz teaching the step,
and then uploads it as a private video to YouTube. They share the link
through posts on their Facebook page only visible to affiliated groups in
other cities, so that when those groups travel to other places any dancer
affiliated to the central organisation will know the same steps and be
able to dance together.
However, social media is important for other, more personal
touches as well. One morning while getting ready for a performance,
all the women in the group gathered at Cecelia’s house to do their hair
and makeup and to put on costumes. Cecelia connected her laptop to
the flat screen television facing the large table in the main room of her
house in order to show the crowd of 12 women a style of eyeshadow
application she had found on Facebook, which had been republished
from a make- up blog. At the same time Alejandra called her mother to
ask a question about how to make a flourish in the traditional dancer’s
hairstyle of two long braids. Using the speakerphone, all the women heard
her mother’s garbled voice respond, ‘I don’t remember, just search for
trenzas on YouTube!’

The Caporales dance group is only one instance of the ways that
individuals bring different forms of social media together. Yet this example
also illustrates the ways in which content from other online sources,
such as blogs and YouTube, becomes reinscribed within other social
media platforms.
YouTube, unlike many social media sites, does not require individuals
to register in order to view videos on the site. Those who do register
can post videos or comment on those posted by others, but most
Hospiceños simply watch widely shared ones – usually instructional,
funny web series episodes and music videos.17 However, they do re- post
these videos on social media such as Facebook, giving YouTube a ‘social’
aspect, though not within the website itself. The frequency with which
they re- post YouTube- based content makes the site key to understanding
the polymedia landscape in Alto Hospicio.
Nicole was one of the few YouTube users I met in Alto Hospicio
who actually posts videos regularly. They are usually videos she records
on her GoPro camera of weekend trips with her family or with her boyfriend
Martin. The videos are usually edited with an added soundtrack
and sometimes intercut with subtitle cards. In one video of a trip she
took with friends to celebrate Carnaval in a small town in the interior
of Chile, she begins by announcing to the camera ‘We are starting our
adventure!’ Set to a club remix of a pop song, the five- minute video
resembles a road trip montage sequence from a coming- of- age movie.
Desert mountains cruise by as the camera faces out of the passenger
window of Nicole’s car. Images of the passengers getting out to stretch
shows more of the landscape. The festival is similarly caught on video,
particularly emphasising the crowd throwing coloured powder, confetti
and water on each other – a practice common in Carnaval celebrations in
the Andes. The video fades out as the song ends and the crowd continues
to dance. This video sits on her YouTube page, along with silly videos
she made during her university course in early childhood education and
other trips she captured with her GoPro camera. Most importantly, however,
she posted it on Facebook to share with those who had gone on the
trip as well as her other friends.
Hospiceño musicians also use YouTube to distribute their latest
songs across different social media. One local reggae group, headed
by a husband and wife who go by their stage names Sista Ebony and
Klandestino, spent a great deal of time and energy composing and
working with a friend to make a video of their latest song. ‘Miseria en
la Periferia’ [Misery in the Periphery] describes life in Alto Hospicio,
using the idea of the periphery as a tool for political mobilisation. Sista

Ebony and Klandestino celebrated completing the song by throwing an
asado barbeque where they showed the video for the first time. The next
day they shared it with all their friends on Facebook. As Klandestino
explained, the group does not have the connections to get their videos
played on television or their songs on national radio programmes. By
using social media, however, they have been able both to find new fans
and to spread their message of social justice.
Both Nicole and the reggae musicians use YouTube as more of a
repository than a separate social media site. The videos that they post
are very personal, but even when others post instructional, comedy or
popular music videos to their Facebook pages, these forms of media
become part of their own repertoires. Similarly a number of public
Tumblr blog sites take on the same function, primarily used by younger
Hospiceños to supplement their social media presence.18 Tumblr allows
users to write original text, but Hospiceños most often use it to curate
collections of photographs, .gifs (Graphic Interchange Format, or animated
image files), videos, links and audio. Though Tumblr offers the
option to viewers to ‘ask a question of the blogger’, it seems that this
mechanism is rarely used by Hospiceños because, unlike a Facebook
message, Tumblr messages do not have the potential to develop into a
chat. Many users choose to eliminate this option from their page so that
interactions are limited to ‘liking’ and re- blogging.
Hospiceños creatively rework the functions of Tumblr in order to
transform sites into collaborative repositories that take on an interactive
aspect. This is particularly true with Tumblr accounts dedicated to
humour. Miguel and Jhony, both in their early thirties and members of
the Red Foxes Motor Club, often spend afternoons in Alto Hospicio sitting
on Miguel’s sofa. They laugh for hours at images and videos shared
on one such site, Jaidefinichon (pronounced ‘High Definition’). Here site
administrators post pictures, videos and links that might be described
as ‘raunchy’: related to drunkenness, sex, drugs and bodily humour. One
morning, for example, the five most recent posts to Jaidefinichon were: a
video of a bull ramming a person, a meme playing on similar syllables
in ‘Ebola’ and ‘Bolivia’, a .gif of a woman shaking her behind unbelievably
quickly, a video of a man falling of a skateboard and a meme about
marijuana using stills from the television cartoon The Simpsons. Jhony
and Miguel both started following Jaidefinichon around 2009. Miguel
explained:
At first it was like a virus. One person telling all their friends, and
that’s how everyone found out about it. A lot of people sent the

link on Facebook in 2009 or 2010. Others just mentioned it to their
friends [in person].
Jhony chimed in:
And the commentary is funny too. There are memes about the
president, videos of dogs walking on two legs and images of weed.
And it’s a different conversation in the comments about each one.
But all funny. Though sometimes I don’t understand. Maybe I’m
too old now.
As Jhony and Miguel explained, users can submit photos, videos or
other sorts of media to the owners of the blog. Those who find the posts
especially funny will click to a direct link to the picture or video, to
share on their own Tumblr or Facebook. Occasionally such memes
are also shared on Instagram as well, or sent via WhatsApp, as Jhony
observed.
People republish things because they want to make their friends
laugh. They also try to write a funny caption for Facebook to show
that they don’t just share funny things; they’re actually funny too.
That’s why funny comments are so important. You have to show
your own creativity.
Miguel also noted:
Everybody sees the same thing and everybody can talk about it
when they get together for a party. It’s not just about seeing it, or
even writing comments online, but you can laugh about it with
your friends when you see them too.
So, as in the case of Jaidefinichon, Tumblr may actually become a very
social form of media in which expressions are shared, contributing to
a sense of commonality and belonging. While these particular Tumblr
pages are a bit raunchy and foster forms of citizenship based in cultural
belonging rather than community engagement, they normativise
through their shared nature. However, the true value of these Tumblr
sites to social media, like YouTube videos, is the way in which the content
becomes translated through its context on other social media sites
such as Facebook.

Reworking self- expression on social media
Linguists use the term ‘intertextuality’ to refer to the way in which placing
a piece of text in a new context changes its meaning.19 In traditional
literary terms intertextuality includes allusion, quotation, translation,
pastische and parody, and many of these genres become apparent when
social media users embed other forms of media within their own and
others’ Facebook walls. Creating an interrelationship between texts,
social media users may transform the meaning of the original text to fit
their own style in a creative re- working. In the process of ‘entextualisation’,
20 social media users create texts for circulation by extracting them
from their original contexts, so that the content references the intentions
of the sharer rather than the creator.
Even when social media users do not post original text or photographs,
seeing their recycled posts as a form of entextualisation reveals
the creativity associated with this type of social media use. By placing
videos, photos, memes, text and sometimes audio into a common space,
individuals actively curate the media that appears on their own and
their friends’ Facebook walls as if they were museum collections that act
as a form of self- expression.
Mixing media components into a bricolage creates an active recirculation
of materials that draw on multiple modes of communication
(text, image, audio, video etc.), aimed at re- appropriating meanings.21
In essence social media users take discourses already in circulation and
make them part of their own new forms of discourse. When Instagram
photographers use filters to stylise a photograph that they then upload as
a new Facebook profile picture, they use Instagram as a means to an end,
rather than as a primary form of social media in itself. In doing so such
users demonstrate their creativity in assembling aspects of the various
media available in order to make it individual. When that same user puts a
YouTube clip of a funny moment from a television programme on a friend’s
wall, the meaning transforms from the original plot of the television
episode to something far more personal shared between two friends.
Rather than seeing this type of sharing as derivative or unoriginal,
Hospiceños understand it as a type of creative reworking of the content
into a new style of discourse that displays the creativity and humour
of the individual who shares the content. As the creativity displayed in
these strategies makes clear, social media is not deterministic. Using
existing media to make new discursive play allows users to retro- fit the
media they wish to use into existing platforms.

During the time of my field work Instagram required all photographs
to be square, but an Insta- photographer could use applications to
create square pictures from landscape or portrait aspect ratios, without
cropping anything out. Facebook has no application for adding sound
bites to one’s own Timeline, but, by posting the YouTube video of the
song a person is currently listening to, he or she allows friends to share
in the sonic experience as well. Unlike with older unidirectional media
such as television, film and radio, Hospiceños actively rework social
media in order to craft their own forms of curation, rather than passively
consume them. So, even though YouTube may look like older media, and
indeed often draws on radio, film and television for content, Hospiceños
appropriate it in ways that are simply not possible with previous media.
The ability to embed these clips in other social media allows people to
exert more impact on media than previously, and the ability to remix
media profoundly changes the context in which the content is newly
embedded. When Instagram photos are shared through Twitter, or
Facebook users tell their friends what songs they are listening to by posting
a YouTube video of the tune, these individuals actively expand the
possibilities of these media platforms.
‘Meme’ is now a household word in most of the world. It refers to a
piece of meaningful communication that spreads, often using mimicry,
from person to person on the internet, including images, hyperlinks,
videos, pictures, websites or hashtags. In Alto Hospicio the most common
form of meme, and that to which I use the word to refer, was of
visual images overlaid with text (see Chapter 3 for examples). Yet these
internet memes take their name from a term coined by Richard Dawkins
in the 1970s, referring to ‘an idea, behaviour or style that spreads from
person to person within a culture’; these are cultural analogues to genes
in that they self- replicate, mutate and respond to selective pressures.22
Dawkins’ concept of the meme has been criticised, however, as lacking
room for agency, change and creativity. Instead understanding media
that is re- shared as part of this intertextuality, curation and even a mode
of performance allows us to understand creativity and change as essential
to this form of reproduction.
From a wide variety of available material, social media users
choose particular things in order to communicate something. They may
share the most flattering images on Instagram or publish childhood
photographs
on Facebook. They may write accounts of the most interesting
bits of their day or chronicle the things that annoy them most. They
may search for the most heartfelt meme or the funniest videos to post
on a friend’s wall. And while individuals do not necessarily consciously

The soci al medi a landsc ape : Perfor ming citi zenship online 59
think of these acts as performance, they are always acts of choice – the
public spaces of social media allow individuals to present themselves as
they would like to be seen.
Understanding what people do on social media as performing does
not necessarily mean that these are conscious acts, but they are nonetheless
meaningful. And seeing them as performance draws attention to the
fact that they are intended for an audience. The semi- public nature of
social media creates a space in which information is expressed with a possibility,
if not expectation, of interaction. Of course the user may never
know if anyone has read it. An Instagram photograph, Tumblr blog post
or Tweet may be sent out into the ether of the internet, and if no one ‘likes’
or comments upon it, the creator will never know if anyone saw it at all.
Yet the potential for interaction makes social media social, because the
person posting the photograph, text or video has created and shared the
item with the intent that someone will see it, and hopefully respond to it.
One factor that underscores the importance of the audience on
social media to Hospiceños is their desire for feedback. While few people
explicitly mention that feedback is important, the extent to which they
prefer media that involves extensive interaction, and concentrate on
the visibility of those interactions, makes clear that Hospiceños, if only
unconsciously, are drawn to social media in which they are aware of the
audience and (at least some of) their responses. Though some scholarship
suggests that the internet is a force that makes people more solitary,
23 this is not true for most users in Alto Hospicio. The social media
sites they choose, and the ways in which they choose to use them, overwhelmingly
focus on social interaction that is based in their local community
and bleeds over into their face- to- face social life with friends,
family and local organisations. The social media platforms that allow
for the most feedback and conversation are popular because they are
reliable for facilitating an audience.
There is nothing about platforms such as Twitter or Instagram
that keeps people from engaging with others through comments and
responses. However, people use Facebook most frequently because they
are most likely to get a response on that platform. This forms a sort of
feedback loop in which people perceive that others use Facebook more,
so when they want feedback they use Facebook to express something,
which in turn keeps others coming back as well. As this cycle continues,
people know that if they want their friends, family, colleagues,
acquaintances and even enemies to see something, Facebook is the place
to express it. In essence Facebook is the most truly social of the social
media for people living in Alto Hospicio.

Because social media provides a semi- public stage for these performances
of the self, it also helps to establish and redefine what is
normative, and what a ‘good citizen’ looks like. The photographs that
people post give a sense of what one should aspire to in terms of one’s
own looks as well as that of their surroundings (see Chapter 3). The
ways in which individuals identify themselves as part of familial relationships
help to shape what people understand as a normative family
(see Chapter 4), while the ways in which people express pride in certain
activities as part of what it means to be a man or woman shape
people’s understanding and expectation of gender (see Chapter 5).24
Even in discussing local or national politics, individuals demonstrate
what sorts of belonging and solidarity are important in the community
(see Chapter 6). Not only do users give their actions meaning
through adhering to normative standards;25 in their public performance
on social media, these very actions help to shape what most
Hospiceños consider normative.26
Of course not all Hospiceños would say that they hope to fit in to
the normative standards of the city, either online or in daily life. Instead
they follow the norms implicitly, producing ‘conformity in the absence
of the intention to conform’.27 Their knowledge of local social norms
is built up through experience, rather than explicitly taught. They act
in accordance with normative behaviours, not through some means
of rational calculation but simply because those behaviours seem natural.
In fact for most Hospiceños the normative social expectations
around them and in which they participate remain invisible.28 Learned
behaviours, naturalised through repetition,29 become mental schemata
of common sense.30
These unwritten but well known rules for social behaviour make
up what might be considered ‘social scripts’31 that express what is taken
for granted32 or seems natural to individuals within the group. Most
people, without even thinking about it, reproduce these social scripts
in their mundane acts and the way they present themselves in everyday
life.33 From the way they dress to the food they prepare, from the way
they greet neighbours to their topics of conversation – whether online or
offline – people behave according to unwritten rules.
Even within these social scripts, however, Hospiceños often express
individual preferences, styles and opinions. While some approach local
politics with gravity, others complain about the national government
with lighthearted humour. In their lives offline some prepare food
using an old family recipe, while others simply mix ingredients according
to their own taste. Social media provides a space for making these

expressions publicly visible. Posting pictures, memes, status messages
and even private messages to friends is as much about self- expression
as about personal communication. While individuals do not necessarily
consciously think of these acts as presentations, they are actively making
choices about how they want to present themselves. In essence social
media provides a stage for performing the self.34 Performing in this sense
is not ‘acting’, but ‘enacting’; not a false representation of a ‘true self’, but
the production of oneself as a culturally recognisable subject.35 These
users characterise themselves, categorise themselves, locate themselves
in relationships to others and situate themselves within the narrative
that they want to tell of their life.36
Building a balanced social media diet
As Francisca, Franklin, Andres and I finished up our colación lunches,
I looked down at my polystyrene container. ‘OK, so if Facebook is the
chicken, what is Instagram?’ With the three interrupting each other,
it was decided as follows: Instagram is the pesto pasta – totally unnecessary,
but it has good flavour and it adds some colour to the plate.
WhatsApp, on the other hand, is the salad – just as necessary as the
chicken, but easy to forget – but when you do, you almost immediately
notice its absence. ‘Twitter is my rice,’ Franklin said, ‘really boring, but
it’s good for filling up. And YouTube is the ají [hot sauce]. I wouldn’t eat
it alone, but if you put it on top of the other stuff, it makes it even better.’
‘And look,’ said Andres, with a fork full of a bit of everything, ‘This is
how you make a Tumblr page’, as the overflowing utensil disappeared
into his mouth.
My lunch companions understand that, for social media to be
enjoyable, a combination of different forms is ideal. It is in the creative
use of multiple forms, not just in complimentary ways but in combination,
that social media gains its popularity in Alto Hospicio. Most importantly
of all, however, the meal must be shared. Whether with family,
friends or acquaintances, social media is useful, enjoyable and even
addictive because it allows people to share common experiences, often
related to their marginalised subjectivity, and to construct a collective
sense of belonging through normativity. Having access to multiple
modes of media in order to do so allows for more possibilities and more
resources in this creative work.
Hospiceños use social media to stay in contact with family, advocate
for local reform, buy and sell items, build friendships, sort out work

logistics, express individual interests and almost always make people
laugh. Yet all of this is done within the social scripts of normativity, performed
for the audience of other Hospiceños looking on through their
computer or smartphone screens. It is clear not only how social media
is understood as a normative mode of communication, but also how it
becomes a tool for social negotiation about what is normative and what
exceeds the boundaries. Social media is at once a private communication
medium, mode of mass broadcast and method of aligning oneself
with various relationships, identities and ideologies, particularly for
expressing identification as marginalised as well as performing as a
‘good citizen’.
