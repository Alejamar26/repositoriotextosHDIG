The Intermediality of Emotion
Representations of Emotionality and Fear in
YouTube Vlogs and Beyond
SILKE JANDL
1. INTRODUCTION
Showing emotions is a core component of successful YouTube vloggers’ careers.
The overt expression of emotions, i.e. emotionality that suggests to viewers
that the expression of emotion is an outburst of authentic feelings, is a precondition
for the intricate relationships viewers develop with YouTubers. Thus,
conveying genuineness in displaying emotions in vlogs is a highly effective tool.
Emotionality regarded as genuine in YouTube vlogs elicits higher view counts
and generates an increased number of sympathetic as well as accusatory comments.
Appreciative as well as derogatory comments ultimately translate into
financial gain; this is especially the case on channels that normally produce
content that is not centred on emotional outbursts. Perceived emotional authenticity
aids in the fostering of loyal fanbases that are keen on consuming their
content as well as building communities. The communities centred around
YouTube personalities are often based on the emotionality that is frequently
implied in vlogs, and as David Matsumoto claims, emotional expressions are
fundamental building blocks of social interaction.1 Even though bursts of emotion
“[…] are often produced in a spontaneous and unintentional fashion, sometimes
defying efforts of expression control or emotion regulations, they can be
produced intentionally and strategically, often with the aim of bestowing greater

authenticity or naturalness to one’s emotional display”.2 Encouraging the notion
of authenticity certainly is of key importance and can determine a YouTube
vlogger’s professional success. However, the debate about whether or not emotions
presented in a YouTube video are “authentic” or staged can already lead to
the viral success of a video. Chris Crocker, for example, who became a meme
after uploading an exceptionally emotional video defending Britney Spears,3
gained fame and notoriety and continues to generate the ongoing interest of
notable news outlets4 following the viral and controversial success of his video.
Given the importance of displaying and/or eliciting emotions in building an
online audience, I will investigate two separate areas of emotion(ality) in order
to give an insight into the complexity of the issue in two interconnected media:
YouTube videos and YouTuber books. Firstly, I will examine the emotions and
emotionality linked to coming out publicly to an established audience on
YouTube. Emotionality, as I will use the term in connection to coming out processes,
refers to the overt expression of one or more “higher cognitive emotions”.
5 Higher cognitive emotions, as outlined by Paul E. Griffiths, include, for
example nervousness, embarrassment, pride, shame and excitement. As an illustration
of how these emotions are depicted in vlog and book form, I will have a
closer look at YouTuber Connor Franta. So called “basic” emotions, however,
and how they are handled intermedially compared to higher cognitive emotions
will be examined in a second focus, namely, on the specific basic emotion of
fear. This will be illustrated with an analysis of British YouTubers’ The Amazing
Book is Not on Fire: The World of Dan and Phil and Jenn McAllister’s Really
Professional Internet Person, as well as their respective audiobooks. Distinguishing
between higher cognitive emotions and basic emotions is of course only
one attempt at better understanding emotions. When writing about emotions, the
examples discussed below show that both kinds of emotion transform somewhat
when transposed from the audiovisual to the written medium. Discussing basic
emotions in written text, however, seems to invite plurimedial representations to
a significantly greater extent than writing about higher cognitive emotions.

THE INTERMEDIALITY OF EMOTION | 177
2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
The intermediality of emotions and emotionality in YouTube videos and in the
books that YouTubers have published in 2015 will be tackled. Since late 2014,
there has been a wave of YouTuber book publications that still continues. Significantly,
almost all of the books written by “Big YouTubers”6 have become instant
bestsellers, nationally as well as internationally. Broadly defined, the theory
of intermediality is used in contexts where the boundaries between two or more
conventionally distinct media are transgressed.7 In Werner Wolf’s typology of
intermediality, he distinguishes between several forms of either intracompositional
or extracompositional intermedialitiy. Adaptation, or “intermedial transposition”,
a form of extracompositional intermediality that deals with the transfer
of meaning-making elements between media, will be a primary focus in the
discussion below. “Plurimediality”, on the other hand, is a form of intracompositional
intermediality and allows the examination of the interactive meaning
making of several media within a video or book. Plurimediality has been termed
differently by various scholars: e.g. media combination by Irina O. Rajewsky or
multimodality by Lars Elleström. These terms all denote a media artefact that
combines two or more semiotic systems to make meaning. Both intermedial
transposition and plurimediality are integral parts of virtually all book publications
by YouTubers and therefore warrant closer inspection. This tendency,
furthermore, begs the question as to whether the visual design and the written
text have equal capacity for meaning-making in contemporary book publications
and whether authors will increasingly be required to consider paratextual elements
when writing books.
The YouTuber books that will be of interest for this paper are primarily
works of autobiographical non-fiction. Rather than independent artefacts, I argue
that these books are adaptations, or intermedial transpositions, of the respective
writer’s YouTube channel. In some cases, chapters in these books are in fact
directly adapted from individual videos.8 The omnipresence of adaptations that
Linda Hutcheon sees in the contemporary cultural landscape, and which she
asserts is “increasing steadily in numbers”, seems to be especially pertinent in
the YouTuber book context and might well have to do with YouTube establish-
6 “Big YouTubers” are the best known, most visible, most influential because of their
large number of subscribers, as opposed to the vast majority of creators with a midrange
subscriber base but more tightly knit community.

8 Cf. Franta 2015: 206-208.

ing itself as a new medium.9 The new media that have evolved recently, Hutcheon
argues, “have clearly fuelled an enormous demand for all kinds of stories.”10
YouTube, and especially the vlog, have accordingly fuelled the need to tell and
consume highly personal stories in particular.
A YouTuber’s main channel is typically intricately linked with their book in
terms of content, style, narrative voice and aesthetics. While YouTubers’ channels
or books can stand alone, the books’ content and success depend to some
extent on the respective YouTube channel. Thus, the books YouTubers have
published recently are perhaps best described as examples of transmedia storytelling.
This concept, as popularized by Henry Jenkins, studies how narratives
can be told via more than one medium and “[…] transmedia storytelling has
been celebrated by media scholars as a narrative model that promotes collaborative
authorship and participatory spectatorship”.11 While transmedia storytelling
in Jenkins’ sense12 disperses parts of a story across several media platforms, with
no hierarchy between the media, it seems more appropriate to look at YouTubers’
books as transmedia expansions, a branch of transmedia storytelling. Henry
Jenkins emphasises the role of transmedia expansions when he says that “[t]he
current configuration of the entertainment industry makes transmedia expansion
an economic imperative […]”.13 Even though the books are for the most part
effective publications in their own right, the frequent implicit and explicit intermedial
references to YouTube videos and the writers’ channels, as well as numerous
“insider jokes” that have been established between vlogger and audience
over the years, essentially make the books transmedia expansions of the
YouTube channels they have grown out of. These non-fictional books can, thus,
be seen as examples of this understanding of transmedia storytelling, as they also
expand the personality brands that YouTubers have been building over the years
through their videos (e.g. by trying to keep in tone with the videos and providing
more – and frequently intimate stories – that have not yet been discussed on
YouTube).
Given that portraying emotion(ality) is a central element in conveying
authenticity in YouTube vlogs, it will be of interest to explore how emotion
transcends media boundaries. Are emotions at the core of YouTubers’ book
publications? Can the portrayal of emotionality translate into the written
medium? Has the discussion of emotionality the potential to elicit the perception

of authenticity? In order to investigate these questions, I will be looking at anglophone
YouTubers who vlog on a regular basis, and who have published an –
at least partly – autobiographical non-fiction book in 2015.
3. YOUTUBERS COMING OUT: CONNOR FRANTA
2015 saw numerous “Big YouTubers” discussing their sexuality and coming out
to their millions of subscribers. Since potential repercussions of coming out
remain problematic, the stakes of doing so publicly are high. This, in turn, frequently
results in an array of emotions being overtly shown on screen when a
YouTuber comes out to their audience. Therefore, the emotionality depicted in
coming out videos will be examined and compared to that in the book chapters
on the topic, in order to illustrate how YouTubers present a myriad of emotions
in either medium. This will be done by having a closer look at the example of
American YouTuber Connor Franta.
Coming out videos have been an integral part of YouTube almost since its
inception. This development has significantly increased recently, as was pointed
out on the official YouTube blog in February 2015:
Coming out videos are a large and important part of YouTube culture: there are more than
36,000 videos related to the subject on the platform today, the sum of which have received
more than 300m views. Last year alone, we saw ~9,600 coming out stories shared on
YouTube – a 20% increase from the year before.14
Coming out on YouTube is extremely popular, as the number of views and
comment responses clearly demonstrate, which consequently makes these videos
financially lucrative. The obvious popularity of coming out videos has given rise
to a rather problematic trend as well: gay-baiting. Especially around the time
several Big YouTubers came out on the platform, others sought to emulate their
success by insinuating, via misleading titles and suggestive thumbnails, that their
videos might also reveal details about their own potentially non-hetero sexuality.
Despite the increased attention and the financial benefits a coming out video
promises, coming out publicly on the platform often entails a negative impact on
the safety of YouTubers. Not only do openly gay YouTubers receive a larger
number of negative, homophobic and offensive comments, but they often also

have to deal with an increased number of threats.15 Nevertheless, those who have
come out on YouTube usually describe the positive reactions they received, the
affirmations of support and the gratitude of those who feel heard and represented
because of the video. Joey Graceffa, for example, claimed that 99% of the comments
on his coming out music video were positive and even encouraged anybody
who needed support to turn to the comment section on either his coming
out music video or his vlog.16 However, the gender divide that most definitely
exists on YouTube seems to favour male gay YouTubers over female gay
YouTubers in this respect. As YouTube user MimiKitty Art observed in a comment
on Franta’s “Coming out” video:17
Figure 1: Screenshot of comment on Franta’s “Coming out” video
Even if the comments are overwhelmingly positive and supportive, coming out
publicly is always an emotional endeavour. The emotionality of the process is
clearly discernible in Connor Franta’s “Coming out” video. Connor Franta has
been a YouTube vlogger since 2010. In five years of sharing personal stories and
anecdotes about his life, however, Franta has only once addressed his sexuality.
Because of the numerous accusatory and derogatory comments suggesting he
was gay, in 2011 Franta uploaded a rather defensive video claiming, as the title
said, “I’m not gay”.18 Only in December 2014 did Franta19 come out to his more
than 5 million subscribers. The video has since garnered well over 11 million
views and seems to have encouraged other creators of the YouTube community
to also come out to their audiences. In April 2015 he published his autobiograph-

16 Graceffa, Joey 2015a: “Don’t Wait” and Graceffa 2015b: “YES I’M GAY”.
17 “You know, looking through this comment section, I find that most people are really
supportive of Connor (I am too) and almost everyone is saying positive stuff. That’s
cool and all, but when I watched ingrid nilsen’s coming out video nearly every single
comment was a butthurt 12 year old! They were all saying how she was faking it, how
those were ‘some fake tears !1!1!!’ And how hers was all for attention. Pretty much
all negative, horrid things. Now, idk what that says…. But think about it :/”.

ical book A Work in Progress: A Memoir in which Franta specifically discusses
his coming out story.
The video “Coming out” and the book chapter “The Long Road to Me”
basically relate the same situation and circumstances. Even though the coming
out video preceded the book publication by several months, it is likely that the
discussion of Franta’s coming out in both media was conceived almost simultaneously.
This is highlighted especially if the temporal delay resulting from editing,
revising, printing and distributing books is compared to the virtual immediacy
of uploading videos to YouTube.
Despite the very clear similarities in content, medium specific affordances
and limits certainly contribute to significant differences between the video and
the chapter. One consequential difference between a vlog, which is presented as
unscripted, spontaneous and immediate, and a published book, which is by necessity
scripted and carefully planned out, is the level of sophistication. While
elliptic sentences and mistakes are a common and accepted feature of vlogs,
there is an expectation for published books to be more complex and to avoid
including any orthographic errors. This increase in complexity can, for example,
manifest in the inclusion of metaphoric language, as the following juxtaposition
of a scene relating the confusion and anxiety triggered by unresolved issues with
homosexuality shows:
“Coming out” A Work in Progress
“I was up all night, for I can’t tell you
how many nights, just thinking. Like
looking at the ceiling, just thinking
about this. And I was so scared of it,
that I never told anybody.”
“Sleepless nights became frequent, and
would carry on for years. I cast all my
confusion up to the ceiling, staring,
wide awake. Worse than that, the selfjudgement
and self-hatred kicked in
for daring to think such taboo
things.”20
As can clearly be seen, the same content is related, but with added metaphors in
the book version. Thus, “looking at the ceiling” is transformed into “I cast all my
confusion up to the ceiling”, thereby creating stronger imagery that seems less
pertinent in a medium that is already dependent on visuality.
Moreover, the quote illustrates the refinement in emotional self-analysis.
While Franta states that he was “scared” to reach out in the video, the book
presents a more precise analysis of Franta’s emotional state by attributing the
suppression of his sexuality to “self-judgement” and “self-hatred.” In a material

sense, the increase in sophisticated, metaphorical language in the written medium
is not only possible and expected, but also more easily included; after all, a
vlog is typically between two and eight minutes long, as opposed to the average
length of memoirs.
There are other changes that also occur due to medium specificity. When
Franta talks about admitting his sexuality to himself in his coming out video, he
says “one year ago, I kept trying to get myself to look in the mirror and say it.”
The same struggle is also related in the book, but in the written medium it comes
with a very specific time reference: “then on the evening of January 3, 2014, I
actually said it.”21 Due to the conventions of YouTube, “one year ago,” as opposed
to “January 3, 2014”, is not significantly less specific, since audiences
tend to consume YouTube vlogs immediately, i.e. within 24 hours of their release,
and because the date when a video was uploaded is easily accessible as it
is always visible right underneath every video.
Besides a more metaphoric way of expression and a higher degree of specificity
in the book, one major difference between the media is that the audiovisual
medium allows for the illusion of a face-to-face conversation. This results
in immediacy as well as perceived authenticity and intimacy. As in actual faceto-
face conversations, the viewer hears and sees the effects of emotion in voice,
facial expressions and posture:

Figure 2-4: Screenshots of Connor Franta’s “Coming out” video
These screenshots illustrate how a moderate outburst of emotionality in Franta’s
video – beginning with the pensive gaze down to one side, the composing glance
down the other side, ultimately culminating in the revelation of teary eyes when
he looks directly at the camera – adds to the emotional impact the video has on
its viewers. David Matsumoto calls these bodily signs “emotional communication”
and states that it “helps individuals in relationships – parent and child,
mates, boss and subordinates – respond to the demands and opportunities of their
social environment. They are basic elements of social interaction […]”.22 Seeing
how particular emotions affect a YouTuber’s body, and especially their face,
also works as a warrant for authenticity and as an invitation for sympathetic
responses. As Mark J.P. Wolf stresses:
22 Matsumoto 2009: 175-176.

Images can do many things that mere words cannot; they are sensually richer and more
immersive, they can present a great deal of detail or information simultaneously and use
complex compositions, and they have a more immediate effect on the audience’s emotions,
from foregrounded dramatic action to subtle effects involving atmosphere and
mood.23
The effect on the audience is evidenced in the innumerable comments on the
“Coming out” videos that express similar reactions to YouTube user Ello Ell:24
Figure 5: Screenshot of comment on Connor Franta’s “Coming out” video
The commenter describes a profound emotional reaction that mirrors Franta’s
when he opines that fear of discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion
or sexuality are “not OK” in his video.25 Franta’s own teary eyes at this exclamation,
as well as the rather inclusive statement, which most viewers will agree
with, aids in eliciting such intense emotional responses. These emotions then,
seemingly, need to be expressed immediately in the form of written commentary
that addresses the impact the video had on the recipient (I/he) as well as a testimony
of support aimed at the YouTuber directly (I/you).
Comments that exhibit the emotional reaction to a video or to other commenters
are numerous. Writing comments most often means writing down immediate
reactions, including emotionality that is often expressed mimetically in
the form of emojis or emoticons. Such responses are in part due to the set-up of
vlogs: vloggers typically film themselves talking to a camera, which means that
what we see in vlogs is, so to speak, a permanent close-up of their face. Even
though there are innumerable differences between television and vlogs, conventions
derived from television have certainly also shaped how vlogs are perceived.
Close-ups of faces are, thus, traditionally associated with the inner self.
As Joanne Finkelstein says,
23 Wolf 2012: 253.
24 “I'm crying so bad when I watch this! Especially the part when he tears up and says
‘it's not ok! It's not!’! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH CONNOR!!􀶙􀶙􀶙􀶙􀶙􀵒􀵒􀵒􀹌􀹌􀀃

THE INTERMEDIALITY OF EMOTION | 185
Through the close-up, thoughts are made visible. […] facial expressions transport the
audience into the deep interior of the mind. The close-up uses the eyes as “the windows”
to the concealed personality. Suddenly the interior becomes exteriorized; certain gestures
and subtle movements – a tear, quiver of the lip, a slight smile – are signs from the interior
of unmeditated, true emotion. These fine facial movements caught by the close-up camera
shot suggest authenticity […].26
Given that the conventional association of the close-up is with the representation
of “unmediated, true emotion”, and given the simulation of face-to-face conversation
in vlogs, YouTubers’ emotional outbursts are often taken at face value.
Audience members consequently tend to uncritically and vigorously defend their
favourite YouTubers against those who question the sincerity of an emotional
expression.
This need to defend a YouTuber against haters stems from the intimate connection
many viewers feel they have with those YouTubers. Over the course of
several years they have witnessed the YouTuber growing up, mature personally
and professionally, go through relationships and share personal stories and feelings
about a variety of subjects. This, in combination with the vlog format, provides
viewers with a wealth of information and insight into the YouTuber’s life,
which gives them the impression that they know them intimately. When she
discusses emotionality and immersion, Marie-Laure Ryan states that “[…] we
are also more likely to be affected by what happens to people we know than by
the fate of strangers”,27 and YouTubers who have shared their lives with their
subscribers for several years in hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of videos
have become more familiar than real-life acquaintances.
The emotions associated with coming out on YouTube – nervousness,
embarrassment, pride, shame, excitement – are all “higher cognitive emotions”
in Paul E. Griffiths’ sense. And as Dylan Evans explains, higher cognitive emotions
“are fundamentally social in a way that basic emotions are not”28 and they
“have been designed by natural selection precisely to help our ancestors cope
with an increasingly complex social environment. […] [T]hese emotions may
well be the cement that binds human society together”.29 The overwhelming
response to and popularity of coming out videos suggests that there is a need,
especially amongst teenagers, to observe and react to emotional content, which is
why even the promise of emotionality draws a large number of people to certain

YouTube videos: through emotionality they offer a platform and, arguably, also
an incentive to engage with one another socially and join the communities that
might already have formed around the YouTuber in question.
4. WRITING AND DEPICTING FEAR: PLURIMEDIALITY
While higher cognitive emotions are clearly connected to coming out videos and
also partly conveyed in book chapters, basic emotions, such as fear, also play a
central role in YouTubers’ content on- and offline. In this second part, mediumspecific
and media transcending strategies will be investigated that convey fear
across different media, in order to show that writing about basic emotions, more
so than than higher cognitive emotions, seems to invite the engagement of visual
elements to augment the meaning-making process. The emotion of fear, as Evans
points out: “is even older than this particular physiological expression [hairs
standing on end]. In fact, fear is probably one of the first emotions ever to have
evolved. It is likely to have been present in the first vertebrates, which appeared
some 500 million years ago or more.”30
4.1 Plurimedial Fear: Jennxpenn aka Jenn McAllister
Nineteen-year-old Jenn McAllister’s autobiographical book Really Professional
Internet Person relates a number of anecdotes – positive and negative – that she
claims she was not prepared to share in vlogs. Among bullying and panic attacks,
she relates the story of how she was doxxed.31 Doxxing is an area of cybercrime
in which hackers steal personal information and make it publicly available
on the Internet. In McAllister’s case, there were severe consequences as her
and her family’s credit card information, their address, their social media account
passwords and their telephone numbers were all freely accessible online.
This meant that all her family had to cancel cards, phones and eventually move
to a different address. Many YouTubers have had to deal with doxxing incidents
and threats. The fact that millions of subscribers are interested in their lives and
seek a personal connection, for example by showing up at their homes or talking
to them on the phone, makes them interesting and sometimes lucrative targets for
hackers. Moreover, prosecution for doxxing and those who make personal in-

formation available online is often impossible, especially since law enforcement
is often struggling to understand the crime at all.
Even though doxxing severely affects the lives of those attacked, many
YouTubers who seem to share so much of themselves and their lives online have
chosen not to discuss actual threats that result from doxxing. McAllister, accordingly,
introduces the topic by explaining that she did not address the incident in
her vlog, “because it was a really upsetting and terrifying period of my life. Of
course, part of me wanted to share this with the Internet, but the other part of me
was too afraid to even talk about it”.32 Serious negative experiences, in fact, are
often not discussed in YouTube videos at all. Most YouTubers expressly produce
positive content on their channel because they are aware of their status as
role models for very young viewers and because their explicit goal is to make
their viewers’ day better with the content they put out. The transmedial approach
to promoting the personality brand of a YouTuber via social media websites
such as Twitter, Tumblr, Snapchat and Instragram creates the impression that
YouTubers, and especially daily vloggers, share every little detail of their lives,
and most of it is cheerful, uplifting and positive. Consequently, being a YouTuber
has become the dream job most teenagers now aspire to33 because the lives
of Youtubers are often perceived as perfect and ideal, exactly because they often
steer clear of negatively connoted incidents.
When Jenn McAllister talks about the fear she felt after being doxxed in her
book, it is not only explicitly verbalized but visualized as well. The whole discussion
of the incident is printed on a black background. The rest of the book is
printed on a light grey, pastel pink or cork background, so that the white font on
black makes the chapter “Life Hacked” a visually striking contrast. Consequently,
McAllister’s autobiographical book utilizes a range of visual as well as written
elements to convey a message, e.g. the differing backgrounds, the inclusion
of numerous photographs, charts, screenshots and fonts. Because of the meaningfulness
of visual aspects in the book, it can be categorized as plurimedial.
Plurimediality is quite common in all YouTubers’ book publications, which is
most likely due to the fact that multiple media are necessarily involved in making
YouTube videos. The visual and the verbal, music, sound effects and written
text superimposed on the image are the important media that characterize
YouTube videos.
Deliberately foregrounding colour, or lack thereof, can be a significant
marker intended by the YouTuber to trigger emotional responses in viewers. In
fact, YouTuber Charlie McDonnell started a trend in 2012 when he uploaded a

black and white video entitled “I’m Scared”,34 which sparked innumerable video
responses – by fans as well as fellow YouTubers – on the same topic, and also in
black and white. Intuitively, the colour black as a visual marker for a frightening
episode and fear in general seems appropriate: particularly bad days are often
referred to as a “black day” in the news, and it is common to describe momentous
and frightening events idiomatically, such as the initiation of the Great
Depression historically being named Black Friday. On the other hand, black is of
course also an iconic representation of a very common human fear that most
humans have probably experienced at some point in their life: the fear of darkness
and the unknown dangers that might be hidden therein.
4.2 Plurimedial Fear: Dan Howell and Phil Lester
The iconic representation of darkness through the colour black and the implication
of unseen dangers is the predominant reason why Dan Howell and Phil
Lester have chosen a black background for a chapter in their book. The two
British YouTubers wrote the book The Amazing Book Is Not on Fire: the World
of Dan and Phil together and it includes two chapters dealing individually with
the two writers’ fears: “Dan’s Fears”,35 and “Phil’s Phears”.36 The visual concept
of these chapters is different from McAllister’s simple black backdrop, as visual
representations of some of their fears and phobias are embedded in the black
background. In Howell’s chapter, for example, trees are visible in the background,
which is an item on his list of fears. In Lester’s chapter the outlines of
horses are distinguishable in the darkness, representing the first item on his list.
Similarly to Connor Franta, Howell also discussed these fears in a video prior
to the publication of the book. Given the timing – the video was uploaded on
29 Oct 2014 while the book was released almost a year later – it is likely Howell
was already working on the book when he decided to make the video. However,
even if the video preceded the conception of the book’s chapter, the intricate
intermedial links between them are undeniable. In the video “My Greatest
Fear”37 he partially rationalizes his fear of the dark by explaining that it is an
evolutionary fear of the unknown and the once very real danger of nocturnal
predators. As Dylan Evans points out in Emotion: A Very Short Introduction,

“[t]he capacity for fear is very useful in a world where hungry predators lurk in
every shadow”.38 Lyons affirms Howell’s assessment when he says,
Thus fear of the dark may not be fear of the absence of light but fear of the absence of
knowledge or, to put it more exactly, fear arising because one does not know what might
be out there in the dark and because one thinks that there might be something to injure or
startle one.39
Contrary to the comparison between Franta’s coming out video and book chapter
on the topic, Howell’s video is more complex and sophisticated than the print
version. In the book, fear is presented in a compact list of specific phobias,
whereas the video engages with research on fears and phobias. When he explains
the distinction between learned and genetic fears, for example, the video is rather
analytical and presents a compelling and ultimately convincing argument. The
list in the book, by contrast, is much shorter, light-hearted, and even sarcastic.
This can be illustrated by the manner in which the fear of the supernatural is
explained: “Poltergeists, witches, demons – you name it, if it’s a magically powered
evil being that defies the rules of reality, I’m terrified of it. Which is funny
because I do not believe that any of those things actually exist. 100%. Go figure.”
40 The aim of this clearly sarcastic exploration of this particular fear does
not point to research on the topic. In part this is probably due to the fact that
Howell and Lester anticipated the book would primarily be consumed by their
fans, who would likely already be familiar with the theories presented in the
video, in which Howell even attempts a scientific explanation of where his personal
fears originate. This leads him to advise his viewers that analysing fears
and where they come from “can help you overcome them”. He thus merges his
research with his personal anecdotes in order to be helpful, which is a common
feature not only of YouTube but quite clearly also of YouTubers’ autobiographical
and advice books.
Almost all of the books YouTubers have published so far can also be experienced
as audiobooks read by the author(s). Even though the physical books are
often innovative and experiment with various forms of intermediality, the majority
of these audiobooks are rather straightforward readings of, exclusively, the
written text. This means that the plurimedial character of these books is not
reflected in any way in their audio version. In their audiobook, Howell and
Lester, however, have taken a different approach to incorporate the added mean-

ing conveyed via visual modes. The numerous photographs, collages, drawing
etc. are adapted into the audiobook, either via dialogue or verbal description and
commentary. Since not all of the visually based content could be adapted into an
exclusively auditive medium, Howell and Lester have also made a pdf document
available to those who purchased the audiobook. Thus, this audiobook exemplifies
the direction audiobooks might take when dealing with the increasingly
plurimedial books on the market.
5. CONCLUSION
Showing emotion on YouTube has an authenticating effect that suggests intimacy,
immediacy and honesty. The combination of these features is expressed in a
plurimedial way in YouTube videos but also in YouTubers’ books. As adaptation
of the YouTube content, these YouTubers seek to translate emotions, at
least partially, into their print books. In accordance with medium specific affordances,
Connor Franta’s “Coming out” video shows bodily responses to emotion.
The book, on the other hand, conveys the emotions connected to his coming
out via elaboration on context and background.
As these books are also transmedia expansions, the upholding of a unified
and coherent personality, voice and visual style are imperative to their success.
Books by YouTubers are marketed and consumed largely as extensions of a preexisting
YouTube channel and thus the two media are inextricably linked. A
YouTuber’s personality and mannerisms thus become crucial components for the
success and effectivity of the book. Key features of voice, style and video aesthetic
are often deliberately transposed into the book medium to enhance the
unity of the YouTuber’s brand and to create an experience of familiarity for
readers.
Intermedial strategies contribute to the experience of the books as transmedia
expansions and adaptations. Plurimediality is often a way to link the aesthetics of
the YouTube channel with the book, but can also serve to mirror the emotionality
of a certain passage or story. Plurimediality can also be a key factor in making
a traditionally monomedial medium like the audiobook into a more effective
intermedial transposition of both the physical book and the online content. Thus,
I hope to have shown how intra- and extracompositional forms of intermediality
and transmedia storytelling can aid in the exploration of how emotion(ality)
transcends the audio-visual medium.
In conclusion, the earnestness and honesty of a public display of emotions on
the part of the YouTuber is to a great extent dependent upon the audio-visual

possibilities of vlogs: quivering lips, shaky voices, flushed faces and watery eyes
all contribute to the perception of authenticity that is so essential for a vlogger’s
career. Viewers, on the other hand, make use of the written commentary feature
to immediately express their emotional reactions and share them with the
YouTuber and their community. Transmedia expansions, such as books and
audiobooks, however, can contribute to the coherence of these personality
brands by providing additional information surrounding emotional biographical
episodes or presenting problematic and negative incidents, thereby adding to the
complexity of the YouTube personality in question. Beyond the coherence and
complexity which the written content is advertised as providing, many YouTubers
seem to value the design of their book – as a physical object for their fans to
cherish and engage with but also as a lasting memento of their achievements –
equally or higher than the written content. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm of
YouTubers for writing and publishing books, as well as their viewers, zeal to
buy, read and respond to them, attests to the continued importance of writing in
general and writing as communication in particular.
