How Has Social Media Changed the Way
We Grieve?
Ellen Lapper
It was 1:30 a.m. My family had been trying for hours to contact me and a point
had been reached where our social media ties prevented them from informing
others. “I don’t want her to find out over Facebook,” said my Mum. The dilemma
being, the more people were told of the news—close family even—the greater
the risk would be of one of them posting online. Today, those privileged
with online access rarely log out. As our offline selves become increasingly
dictated by our online presence and our lifestyles rely on mobile devices and
social media, it becomes all the more pressing to investigate the impact of this
phenomena on the inevitable accompaniment to our existence: death. Our
social media platforms alert us of a death before traditional forms of media
such as newspapers, radio or television have the chance (Carroll & Landry
2010). This phenomenon was clearly demonstrated by frenetic activity on UK
social media sites following the passing of David Bowie and Alan Rickman
at the beginning of 2016. The news of both deaths became ‘Trending Topics’
on Facebook. Media coverage was dominated by now familiar announcements
stating that thousands of tributes were pouring in via Twitter. One user posts
a photo, another shares a video and the hashtag ‘#RIP[insert celebrity’s name]’
goes viral.

Due to the scope and sensitivity of this topic, it would require extensive analysis
to address all the surrounding issues fully, something I quickly appreciated
from the outset. I began looking into the role of memory in the digital age with
the rather broad question: how do technological advancements affect, aid or
hinder the way we remember someone who has passed away? However, as my
research progressed, the nature of my question changed slightly. Despite the
original enquiry still playing a prominent role, my specific focus became: To
what extent has social media changed the way we grieve?
Digital Traces
My father, who was not an active social media user (WhatsApp only), passed
away recently. Despite his physical absence, I continue to notice ways in which
his digital presence seeps through. I constantly scroll through his iPhone
photos and re-read his WhatsApp chat; essentially I’m becoming dependent on
digital means to remember him. Hannah Arendt (1970) expressed her fear of

technology in doing the thinking for us, predicting the takeover of machines
long before the invention of the smart phone. Our answers are now at the push
of a button and our dependency on such tools has increased. It is becoming rare
to hand-draw a route in advance of a journey—Google Maps will simply show
us the way on our portable device. If it is becoming optional to remember, does
this imply we are becoming better at forgetting?
For Adi Ophir (2005), traces are things that something, or someone, has
left behind once they have disappeared or become lost. These traces relate to
reminders for the memory. In terms of death, we are (to an extent) prepared
for physical traces to remain present as relics, acting as a trigger to activate and
unlock a deeper thought—for example, I knew my Dad’s shoes would still lie
by our front door and his guitars would sit gathering dust. Despite operating in
the same way, what I was not prepared for, and what I believe has changed with
technology’s dominance, are these same triggers lingering within our digital
environments.
For the past few years, I have accidentally left myself logged into my Gmail
account, which is synced to YouTube on my father’s iPad and laptop. Whenever
he watched a video, my account took note. As a result, my recommendations
were always an odd mix of bike videos, live performances of the band ‘Big
Country’, bass guitar tutorials (Dad’s videos) and things that I had watched,
such as bunny show jumping, food challenges and 90’s R&B. This underlines
technology’s omnipresent ability to curate a digital persona for us. This online
curatorship of the self may not be as obvious as a Facebook profile, where the
user actively mediates the information they reveal, however, it is nonetheless an
online reflection of an offline personality.
Four months after my father’s passing, my YouTube recommendations were
devoid of any of his videos (except perhaps one of the ‘Buzzcocks’)—everything
else I could vouch for. In the absence of my father’s viewing, my YouTube profile
acquainted itself once more to my taste. “Disappearance to the second degree;
the gradually diminishing presence of the traces, the gradual depleting identity
of what disappeared, to the point where all that can be said is: ‘There was
something there’” (Ophir 2005: 52).
Dad’s swift exile from YouTube struck me. Perhaps he just did not watch
enough videos, but what would it be like to lose someone more active? One
moment: notifications, event invitations, comments, Tweets on Twitter, Facebook
timeline domination, and then ... silence; a digital presence lost. Or is it really
gone—in a physical sense? When thinking of others in recent mourning, I
realized that I had invariably discovered the news of their losses on Facebook.
How then are social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube
affecting grief?
I am an active Facebook user and therefore required no real introduction
to the site. Once contact was made over Facebook, the aim was to explore the

grief experiences of others on alternative social media platforms; however, the
scope was too large. Primarily this research became about Facebook. I initially
reached out to five Facebook users through the platform itself and later met
them in person. Further research would require not only an extension outside
of my social network but also an extension outside of England. The majority
of my Facebook network consists of, though is not limited to, other Englishspeaking
users based in England. Having said that, I have also noticed that
people within my Facebook network who reside in England are much more
active on social media than friends who reside elsewhere, partly explaining
my selection. The idea that social media has decreased our privacy in England
(Miller 2016) cannot be a worldwide generalization, so the geographical focus
must be taken into consideration. My questions extended to:
How is a person remembered on a social media site such as Facebook?
What are the motives for users, close family even, for carrying out this form
of remembrance?
How has social media changed the boundaries between public and private?
What are the implications of such posts?
Methodology
Social media allows us to easily participate in an otherwise passive world; it’s
not like television (Agger 2012). Agger is critical of the overly sharing nature
of Facebook, stressing the need for a return to the division between public and
private. I must admit, I too held a skeptical stance over publicizing a death or
sharing a memory of someone who has passed away on Facebook. One Facebook
user, Patti, whom I knew personally and had recently suffered a loss, told me
that she would never consider announcing that news on Facebook. “I will tell
the people I want to know. I don’t want my whole Facebook network knowing
that information; it’s very private. It’s just selfish and attention seeking.” No
doubt, Agger too would call for a retreat back into the private sphere. However,
announcing a death was seldom a private affair; in England obituaries are not
new and traditional gravestones in cemeteries are accessible to the public. Still,
social media has created a bridge between public broadcasting and private
communications (Miller 2016). Unlike a printed obituary, which goes out
once to a mass audience, close to the time of death and with no real invitation
for response, such notifications of grief on social media are immediate and
interactive. They come directly from a user, with a curated profile, friend list,
previous posts and the ability to mediate an audience.

Facebook Messenger chat with Dominic. February 2016.
The instantaneous nature of publicly expressing grief on social media
paradoxically presents us as vulnerable to a wider audience, yet the technological
distance somehow protectively shields us. Agger’s (2012) criticism is based on
the belief that people overshare online in ways they wouldn’t face to face. For
Stella, a Facebook user who lost both her father and brother (the former before
the prevalence of social media, the latter in the midst of it), it was exactly this
factor of distance that helped her share the news of her loss; she didn’t know
where to begin in person.
It took me forever, to put it up on Facebook and what to write, blah blah but then, it was
kind of like a sense of relief. But then you know when you’re a bit like, oh my God, now
what?! It was just really hard […] but I was so glad that I could put it up on Facebook
cos people know and people were like, “When can I come to the funeral? When is it?”
Stella’s last sentence shows exactly how such posts invite immediate interaction
and the support that people need at times of instability. The appeal of technology
becomes clear when we are most vulnerable, as Sherry Turkle stated in her
TED talk1. She elaborated that—in using this medium, as opposed to physical
interactions—we have the ability to edit our content and present the self as we
prefer to be seen. This could partly explain why, when announcing sensitive
news concerning death, users find comfort and ease in communicating over
sites such as Facebook, as the written form allows for better formulation.

When initiating contact with Facebook users in my network, I began by
using the Messenger tool. The messages (Image 2) I exchanged with one user,
Dominic, are grouped together as they were sent seconds after each other.
The narrowing of the audience and the chat set-up allows us to create a more
rapid, intimate dialogue; however, a slight delay in the construction of the
text gives us the ability to recompose. Dominic’s messages revealed positive
repercussions of posting his loss online. It triggered “a world I never really
knew being introduced to me through social media.” Stella also noted this
“nice” revelation of another side to the deceased’s life through pictures shared
on Facebook. Arguably, these shared photos uploaded by friends could have been
brought physically to the bereaved person. However, the potential immediacy
of a response from an extensive audience elicits a different kind of interaction.
Distance aside, users can choose to what extent they engage with the variety of
media-sharing Facebook offers. Facebook’s language of ‘sharing’ and ‘friending’
entice us to feel comfortable in using social media.
The sharing of a memory on social media accelerates Maurice Halbwachs’
(2011) otherwise natural theory that all our individual memories are formed
within a societal structure, and can then only be understood in a group context.
Does online sharing then add another layer to its collectiveness? By allowing
others access to this perhaps once-private memory, we force it out of our
personal sphere and into the minds of others. When exposed to shared trauma
or traumatic knowledge, past events can seem to constitute the memories of the
generation that follows; their memories become our memories (Hirsch 2011).
What effect does social media have on this form of collective memory? Do the
memories of people on our Facebook timeline become our memories? When we
see something within our social network, are we lured into thinking it is ours?
I discussed this with Faye, who recently lost a friend and put out a tribute to her
on Facebook. Faye agreed that Facebook often has the ability to make you believe
you knew something about someone, or were present at the time an event took
place, only later to discover that you learnt it via passive observation online. In
this sense, others’ posts are subconsciously becoming our memories or our
collective memories.
Faye elaborated, “I wouldn’t normally post something like that but it was
the way she lived her life—she was very open on Facebook about everything
and I wanted to honor that. It invited such a response; I got so many, so many
messages, all such lovely words, was so comforting.” We concluded that
perhaps it helps to share the pain. The conversation in which we shared our
experiences might not have taken place had I not seen her Facebook post. The
interactivity of such shared information on Facebook is exactly what makes it
different from printed obituaries—it invites an immediate response. Similarly,
Stella enjoys sharing memories concerning her lost loved ones for their
interactive connectivity—on an anniversary or birthday, for example. This is

what I understood from everyone to be most comforting. As these memories
are shared within their networks, others can comment, ‘Like’ and attempt to
share the experience.

of her brother’s funeral. December 2015.
For Arendt, whatever is experienced internally is valueless unless shared with
another. “Pain […] is so subjective and removed from the world of things and
men that it cannot assume an appearance at all” (1970: 51). She expands her
view on physical pain within our body as being the only thing that you cannot
share, however, I would argue that grieving is physical pain. The bereavement
posts on Facebook could be a result of our struggle to share this physical,
internal pain by using the alternative forms that social media offers to us. Texts
and words aside, users can share videos, post photos or use emoticons; all these
options endeavor to express something where vocalization fails. The process of
posting offers users opportunities to connect with others who may share similar
experiences or offers messages of support, as illustrated in Image 3. The
emoticons replace text. Some 87 people ‘Liked’ the post and 97 comments were
made—many of which stated: “so sorry to hear that”, indicating it was the first
time they learned of this news. Somewhat ironically within this context, though

I do not doubt the sincerity, the comment shown at the bottom—“Memories we
hold in our hearts forever” almost pulls us back to humanity for a second and
out of this virtual sphere. I would argue that online sharing and the use of
technology to express grief and memorialize has the ability to become the new
form of collective memory, although perhaps we are not fully conscious of it yet.
Wailing over WhatsApp
Halfway into this research, I became a victim of my own stupidity, curiosity and
digital culture. Upon seeing an image online, supposedly from Apple, claiming
to show you what your iPhone would have been like in 1970, I followed the
instructions and set the date to January 1st 1970. In an instant, I had ‘bricked’
my phone and it refused to turn on. I cried. I wasn’t crying over the device
itself, rather the loss of the WhatsApp chat and iMessage history held in my
‘phone—essentially the last conversations with my now deceased father. I was
wailing over meaningless chat, usually in the form of attempts to organize
something banal like who was going to pick the milk up, which, if written
down on paper, would most definitely be in the bin right now. I truly believed
I needed to resurrect this “biological development of mankind” (Heisenberg
1955: 14-15). Thankfully after a stint in the Apple store, the iPhone was restored
but my chats were wiped. I could still log on to my father’s phone and read it
there, but it wouldn’t be the same. I couldn’t bring myself to activate Dad’s
digital presence by changing: ‘last seen 20 November 2015’—the day he died
(Image 4).
Stella and I exchanged our devastating WhatsApp experiences. She had lost
her conversation with her brother Trev, which along with a written letter, he
had used to say goodbye.
Luckily I went into a phone shop and they connected [his phone] back up for me. So I got
[the WhatsApp conversations] back, but they’re not on my phone and it’s not the same. I
don’t want them on his phone. I thought ‘I’ll send them to me’. And then I thought ‘I don’t
wanna do that’, but obviously the date changed.
Stella referred to the same issue I had with the “last seen online…” which is
displayed on most users’ WhatsApp:
And then people were like, “what the hell, his phone’s on?” Texting me and Mum and I
was like, “No it’s me! It’s me.” I thought do I put the WhatsApp status up saying, “it’s his
sister”? But he’d put his status as “I love you Stella and Mum, I’m sorry”. And that was
like his last status, and I thought I don’t wanna delete that but these people were like
“fuck all my messages are sending”.

Bernadette, an active Facebook and WhatsApp user, spoke of her loss:
He’s still in our uni WhatsApp group. I found it odd at first when I saw his name at the
top but we’ve just had it since uni so we’re just gonna keep using it. Obviously when we
make new groups to arrange stuff we don’t add him in like we used to but yeah, he’s still
there in the main one.

The digital presence for WhatsApp requires a separate analysis in comparison
to Facebook. Generally, it is for private, instant messaging—usually just oneon-
one—but also useful for groups to communicate, normally with people
they know personally. Messages often contain a mix of banal and significant
exchanges, the latter demonstrated in Trev’s goodbye. Stella’s resurrection of
Trev’s WhatsApp sparked a disturbed response; I am also reluctant to bring
my father online again. We are ill-equipped in dealing with the remains of a
digital presence and we can’t bear to lose them. Aside from YouTube perhaps,
this illustration reinforces the impact of social media presences on our society;
they cannot be easily removed. Our initial exposure leads us to believe that we

need these presences to remain in order to remember. As Stella said, “If I didn’t
have it at all then I wouldn’t feel that much pain over something.” I am also now
struggling to recall what I wrote about with Dad, what pictures we exchanged
and who picked the milk up. It is tough; I want that little device to help me.
However, perhaps we need to forget in order to remember (Augé 2014).
Digital ghosts
The preservation of a digital presence became more apparent as my research
continued. Bernadette told me that the Facebook profile of her late friend
remains unchanged and has not been memorialized.2
Bernadette went on to express her annoyance when people write on her
friend’s Facebook Wall:
He’s not there anymore, he’s not going to read it. But maybe that’s just because I always
think scientifically. I don’t know why it annoys me. His best friend got so irritated ‘cos it
sparked loads of other people to write on his wall. People that didn’t even know him. Even
this girl he dated for just a few months. I don’t know who has access to his Facebook.
Ari Stillman (2014) discusses the possibility of a collaborative identity
construction based around the deceased’s Facebook Wall. His idea, that the
“identity of the deceased belongs to those who construct it” (ibid: 59) in turn
helps shape a collective memory of the individual. Could it be that the Facebook
profile becomes a memorial, even if it has not been officially memorialized
through Facebook’s given terms? I would argue, yes. There are some individuals,
like Bernadette, who do not like the idea of the profile being active as it invites
others to craft an identity of the deceased. She elaborated on the posts of the
“girl he dated for a few months”—in that they didn’t correspond to anything
she or the close friends knew—yet appeared publicly on his profile, asserting
her apparent relation to him. Despite this, she said she wouldn’t want it
otherwise—she couldn’t imagine the deletion of his profile. It is simply easier
to do nothing, which in turn risks misinterpretation as disbelief of the death.
Faye explained her interaction with her late friend’s Facebook profile:
2 | Facebook offers a “memorialized account” as a way of remembering the deceased.
Essentially, the profile remains and current friends can interact with it, however no new
friendship requests can be sent and the user does not appear in searches or birthday
reminders. Memorializing a profile was a function introduced by Facebook in 2009.

I just can’t stop going on it. But it’s weird, I can’t search for her and click on her profile.
I have to do it through someone else who is a mutual friend, and then I see her photo
there and I just click on her via this other friend. I just want to look at her profile. But I
don’t want her to appear in my recent searches. I don’t know why.
When asking if it was because people had posted things on her Facebook
timeline, she said, “No. She has like a Timeline Review, so what you can see
on her wall is very limited.” Facebook profiles are ultimately private, individual
constructs of a user yet, at the same time, they are not the only ones crafting
their online identity (Davis, Sieder & Gardner 2008). Social media is social.
When a user passes away, despite Timeline privacy restrictions, the interaction
with what remains can still maintain this collaborative process and develop into
a form of collective memory.
Ophir (2005) talks about the inseparable interchangeability between
disappearance and appearance much in a similar sense to Marc Augé’s (2004)
discussion of memory’s relationship to oblivion. For Augé, we must forget in
order to remain present. To an extent I agree, however, I would rather argue
for us to push these memories aside to make way for new ones. The reduction
of these memories into traces allow for their dormant storage. Then, as Ophir
explains, “Some thing has to remain present ‘to this day,’ and first and foremost
here and now, in order to testify to what has disappeared” (Ophir 2005: 52). The
digital reminders I have discussed are testament to that loss. Stella explained
how she never had the option with her first bereavement. Only now the feeling
of deprivation arise:
They’re like old pictures, they’re like really crap pictures, whereas Trevor’s are like
amazing, it’s almost...made it harder on my Dad, cos I think, God it was so long ago. I
don’t feel like it’s a long time ago, but I don’t have any of the things, like I can’t remember
my Dad’s voice. And it kills me. I can’t remember it at all, like what his tone of voice was
or anything. And I hate that and I feel like I’ve forgotten it. With Trev, I’m like always
gonna be able to hear that. I’m always gonna hear his laugh. And that is only through
having a video on my phone. But other times people hate having all that, cos you know,
you’ve gotta be in the right mood, and ready for it, and if you’re not, then it like takes
you like ten steps back.
There is actually no difference between the effect of the physical and digital
reminders left behind when someone passes away; when unprepared, both can
set you back. The differences lie in the possibilities that digital technologies
offer us now, as Stella describes:

With Trev, I can put so many pictures up [on Facebook] and I love it. And I can just
change pictures all the time and then I feel like, oh my God am I letting my Dad down? I
need a picture of my Dad but there’s like only the set 7 or 8 I’ve got of him.
Loss in the digital age simply provides us with more. Despite our integration
into digital technologies, it is this bombardment that we are still coming to
terms with and are currently unable to process. Initially, one thinks of the
bombardment as constant reminders, however when relating this back to Augé
(2004), the increase provided by the digital age could potentially make it harder
for us to forget.
Conclusion
This preliminary research into grief and social media has primarily revealed
its extensive complexities, in which humanity is constantly catching up with
technology. As worlds between offline and online blur, we must become better
acquainted in how to deal with the loss of an online presence. Particularly within
Facebook, there remain many unexplored topics, including the memorialization
of a Facebook profile (which none of my sources were aware of) and—through
Facebook’s introduction of a legacy contact—the problems in acquiring access
to digital assets in the case of the bereaved (see Image 5.).
Other considerations also arose, such as the possibility to continue crafting
your online identity after death (using apps such as If I Die), the nature in
which we remember on Facebook (changing profile pictures) through to the
manner in which people interact after death (‘Like’, comment, share, private
message, etc.). My study touched upon three social media platforms used by
England-based users, however worldwide there are plenty more with varying
purposes and modes of interaction which would produce a different cohort of
results.

Of the users I spoke with, the ones who announced their loss or posted tributes
regularly share information, so perhaps, despite the difficulty in phrasing,
grieving on social media is a normal and comfortable outlet for those who are
already integrated and accustomed to posting. The breakdown between private
and public provided by social media creates a protective, technological shield.
Most people simply announced their loss via a status update, however in the
case of Stella, she regularly uses Facebook to share a memory (normally photos)
of her lost ones. The benefits of such actions are highlighted through the speed
and immediacy of the scope in which we can interact, connect and share. It is
consoling to receive messages, share photos and form a collective memory of a
late individual. If anything, this study has opened my opinion on the ‘oversharing’
nature of grief on social media. Whilst I am still hesitant to perform it myself, it
is essentially just like in real life. Grieving is a natural process that requires the
comfort and support of others to heal. Social media platforms, as extensions of
our brains, are aiding us. WhatsApp interaction requires additional research but
currently serves to highlight our unpreparedness in dealing with a loss online.
As our digital presence bleeds into our lived reality, everything—including
death—must take its course. Similar to the physical reminders left behind by

the deceased, as our lives become digitalized, these naturally take form online;
only we are still acclimatizing.
